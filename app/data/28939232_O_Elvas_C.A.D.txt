The union between the two clubs from Elvas was fundamentally due to the lack of interest shown by the so-called mother clubs, since in the mid-1940s, both SL Elvas and SC Elvense were experiencing some financial difficulties and given the lack of aid several times requested and refused by their mother clubs, they decided to unite in a single club and in this way, managed to keep the king sport alive in the interior region. Thanks to the status of "SL Elvas", which already competed in the 1st Division, "O Elvas" continued it five times, in the 1940s. It debuted in 8th place in 1947/48, with victories against big clubs, such by 1/2 over SL Benfica, with two goals from Patalino or the 5/0 thrashing of Boavista and the 3/1 victory against SC Braga, followed by a 9th place in 1948/49 and 13th place in the following season, being, therefore, relegated to the second tier.
