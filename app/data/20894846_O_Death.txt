20894846	O Death	"O Death", also known as "O, Death", "Oh Death" and "Conversations with Death", is a traditional Appalachian folk song, listed as number 4933 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song is generally attributed to the musician and Baptist preacher Lloyd Chandler, but it was likely taken or adapted from folk songs already existing in the region. == Variants == The original version, as performed by Lloyd Chandler and members of the Wallin family: A modified version with a chorus and different tune, performed by Dock Boggs, Nimrod Workman, Ralph Stanley and others: == Origin == thumb|First line reads: Death/ O, sinner I'm come by heaven's decree, my warrant is to summon thee.In 2004, the Journal of Folklore Research asserted that "O, Death" is Lloyd Chandler's song "A Conversation with Death", which Chandler performed in the 1920s while preaching in Appalachia. Chandler's daughter-in-law, Barbara, asserted that "O, Death" was based on Chandler's composition. However, Chandler seems to have taken the song from another source or at least based it on an older version. In 1913, the Journal of American Folklore printed a version sung by "Eastern North Carolina Negroes" 1908:This version seems closer to the version first performed by Dock Boggs than Chandler's "original" version. Encounters with a personified "Death" featured in traditional English songs which possibly date to the 14th century, including "Death and the Lady" (Roud 1031), which was found in the oral tradition in early twentieth century England. "O Death" bears a strong resemblance to a broadside ballad printed in Ireland in 1870, entitled "A Dialogue Between Death & the Sinner" (pictured). ==Recordings== Country blues 1920s banjo player Moran Lee "Dock" Boggs recorded the song in 1963 after his 'rediscovery' during the Folk Music Revival. A recording from the 1938 National Folk Festival in Washington, D.C. by an unknown singer is held by the Library of Congress. Various folk music artists included "O, Death" on musical collections throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Wichita Eagle, Op. cit. It is sung in the 1976 Barbara Kopple documentary Harlan County, USA by early union activist and coal miner Nimrod Workman, a well known folk music singer from Mingo County, West Virginia. In the 1960s, Alan Lomax recorded the folk and gospel singer Bessie Jones singing "O Death". Lloyd Chandler's recording of "A Conversation with Death" appears on Rounder Records 1975 release High Atmosphere: Ballads and Banjo Tunes from Virginia and North Carolina, a collection of recordings made by John Cohen. Among the most famous recordings is Ralph Stanley's version in the 2000 Coen brothers film (and soundtrack album) O Brother, Where Art Thou?, for which Stanley won the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2002. The soundtrack's producer, T-Bone Burnett, originally asked for a banjo rendition emulating Dock Boggs, but Stanley convinced him otherwise with an a cappella performance in the style of the Appalachian Primitive Baptist Universalist church."Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 Virginia Living, p. 57.
