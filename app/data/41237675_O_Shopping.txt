41237675	O Shopping	O Shopping was a Philippine pay television channel owned by ACJ O Shopping Corporation, a joint-venture between Philippine entertainment and media conglomerate ABS-CBN Corporation and South Korean home shopping company CJ ENM O Shopping Division. The channel was launched on October 14, 2013. O Shopping programs were previously aired on ABS-CBN and Kapamilya Channel during midnights, as well as on Jeepney TV, S+A, and online via iWantTFC. ==History== O Shopping was launched on October 14, 2013, when ABS-CBN Corporation signed a deal with CJ ENM O Shopping Division (formerly CJ O Shopping Corporation) to create a TV home shopping channel in the Philippines. Operated by ACJ O Shopping Corporation, ABS-CBN Corporation invested an initial 200 million pesos for the joint-venture. ABS-CBN provides the media platforms and the production of programs while CJ O Shopping provides the products and the logistics. Prior to the launch of its standalone channel on July 30, 2018, O Shopping programs were launched as part of BEAM TV's content lineup in 2014 until October 1, 2018, and later via ABS-CBN TVplus' encrypted channels 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM from Monday to Thursday during their respective main programming downtime. As of 2016, O Shopping generated 2.2 million pesos in daily sales or 60 million pesos in monthly sales. About 70% of the product purchases on O Shopping are made via cash on delivery payment, with a 5% cancellation rate. ===Dissolution=== O Shopping was put off-the-air on ABS-CBN Channel 2 on April 21, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. The channel also suspended its operations on digital terrestrial television and Cignal. O Shopping was affected by the ABS-CBN shutdown on May 5 of the same year due to the cease-and-desist order (CDO) issued by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and Solicitor General Jose Calida caused by the expiration of ABS-CBN's legislative franchise. On July 8, 2020, ABS-CBN released a statement that O Shopping would cease operations towards the end of 2020, and CJ-ENM has decided to move out of business completely. The retrenchment of employees was held on August 7. O Shopping ceased its operations on Sky Cable and iWantTFC on November 1, 2020. It was replaced by Movie Central Presents movie block on Kapamilya Channel and its channel space was replaced by A2Z. Meanwhile, the official online store website operated a "Good-BUY Sale" online promo event which lasted until November 15 and ceased on the day. ==Final hosts== ;Main hosts * Victor Anastacio ) * Cara Eriguel * Hiyasmin Neri * Lesley Lina * Sandro Hermoso * Justine Pe√±a * Jamie Gabuya * Maiko Williams * Kyle Ortega * Adi Amor * Andre Co * Cholo Dela Cruz ;Guest host * BJoy Balagtas ;Celebrity guest host * Pokwang ==Programming block== * ABS-CBN * BEAM TV * Cine Mo!
