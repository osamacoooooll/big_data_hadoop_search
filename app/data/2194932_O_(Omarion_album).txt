"Chart Watch Extra: What A Turkey! The 25 Worst- Selling #1 Albums" . Yahoo! Music. November 21, 2008. ==Critical reception== The album received mixed reviews by critics. Billboard contributor Gail Mitchell praised the collaboration between Omarion and his producers for delivering "a healthy helping of repeat-worthy songs." Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly said of the record, "[T]he ballads on this solo debut have way too much whipped cream, but there are some surprisingly tough touches of funk and crunk ("Drop That Heater," the Missy-esque "Take It Off")." AllMusic editor Andy Kellman said that the album works best when the tracks are "lighthearted, summery funk ("Never Gonna Let You Go (She's a Keepa)") and have production done by the Neptunes ("Touch") and Rodney Jerkins ("Drop That Heater") instead of being overly sexual, concluding that "Had Omarion been less concerned with street credibility, realizing that it might be better to allow his young fan base to mature along with him, this debut would've been more than satisfactory." Kathi Kamen Goldmark of Common Sense Media also found the content overdone in its musings of sexual imagery, saying that it sounds "more jarring than seductive", concluding that "[T]here's a lot of potential here, if the artist can come up with some better, more subtly sexy material." ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 182,000 copies in its first week of release. In its second week, the album dropped to number eight on the chart, selling an additional 77,000 copies. In its third week, the album fell to number 12 on the chart, selling 45,030 more copies. On March 31, 2005, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. As of April 2012, the album has sold 765,000 copies in the United States. ==Track listing== ;Notes * signifies a co- producer * signifies an additional producer *"I Wish" featured background vocals by Omarion and Quintin Aney. *"O" featured background vocals by Tank and Eric Dawkins. *"I'm Tryna" featured background vocals by Tank and Dawkins. *"Drop That Heater" featured background vocals by Omarion and Sean Garrett. *"Never Gonna Let You Go (She's a Keepa)" featured background vocals by Charles "Charlie" Crawford and Jamie Vick. *"I'm Gon' Change" featured background vocals by Omarion, One Chance and Pierre Medor. ;Sample credits *"Never Gonna Let You Go (She's a Keepa)" contains a replay of "Electric Frog (Part II)" as written by Richard Westfield, George Brown, Robert Bell, Ronald Bell, Claydes Smith and Robert Mickens. ==Personnel== Adapted from the O media notes. * Joel Campbell – bass, keyboard * Carey Drisdom – bass * Bryan Tate – trumpet * Ryan Tate – trombone * Percy Richard, Omarion Grandberry, Marques Houston, Henley Regisford Jr., Chris Stokes – executive producers * Pharrell, Darkchild, Chris Stokes, Tank, The Underdogs, Sean Garrett, Corna Boyz, AllStar, L.T.
