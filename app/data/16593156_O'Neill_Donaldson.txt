16593156	O'Neill Donaldson	O'Neill McKay Donaldson (born 24 November 1969) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He notably played in the Premier League for Sheffield Wednesday, as well as in the Football League with Shrewsbury Town, Doncaster Rovers, Mansfield Town, Oxford United, Stoke City and Torquay United. He also started and finished his playing career in non- league with Hinckley United and Halesowen Town respectively. ==Career== Donaldson began his career at non-league Hinckley United where his form attracted the attention of English Football League scouts, leading to him ultimately signing for Shrewsbury Town in November 1991. Donaldson did not gain a regular first team spot at the club, most often appearing as a substitute and was given a free transfer to Doncaster Rovers in 1994. Although he did not gain a regular first team place at Rovers either, Donaldson's reputation grew from a brief but goal-heavy spell on loan at Mansfield Town and it was his form at that club which convinced Sheffield Wednesday to sign him for £50,000.Sporting Digest Donaldson made his debut for the Owls as a sub against Manchester City on 18 March 1995.O'Neill Donaldson However, he quickly faded from the first team picture at a time when Wednesday boasted the likes of Mark Bright and David Hirst up front and Donaldson was forced to settle for a reserve role at the Hillsborough club. He largely impressed during a loan spell at Oxford United, although then manager Malcolm Shotton blamed the player's agent for blocking a deal that would have brought Donaldson to the Manor Ground on a permanent basis.O'Neill to stay at Hillsborough Indeed, such was the desire to see Donaldson remain at the club full-time that a local fanzine editor even wrote to the player in an attempt to convince him to reconsider.Fanzine appeals to O'Neill Ultimately Donaldson was released by Wednesday in March 1998 for a frustrating two-month spell at Stoke City, before he spent a further three years at Torquay United where injury and a lack of form once again denied him a regular first team place. He left the league in 2001 for a brief spell at Halesowen Town in the Western Division of the Southern Football League before retiring from football. ==Career statistics== Source: Club Season League FA Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Shrewsbury Town 1991–92 Third Division 19 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 20 2 1992–93 Fourth Division 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1993–94 Third Division 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2 Total Total 28 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 29 4 Doncaster Rovers 1994–95 Third Division 9 2 0 0 2 0 1 0 12 2 Mansfield Town (loan) 1994–95 Third Division 4 6 1 1 0 0 0 0 5 7 Sheffield Wednesday 1994–95 Premier League 1 0 0 0 0 0 — — 1 0 1995–96 Premier League 3 1 0 0 0 0 — — 3 1 1996–97 Premier League 5 2 0 0 0 0 — — 5 2 1997–98 Premier League 5 0 0 0 0 0 — — 5 0 Total Total 14 3 0 0 0 0 — — 14 3 Oxford United (loan) 1997–98 First Division 6 2 0 0 0 0 — — 6 2 Stoke City 1997–98 First Division 2 0 0 0 0 0 — — 2 0 Torquay United 1998–99 Third Division 12 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 1 1999–2000 Third Division 15 0 3 1 0 0 2 1 20 2 Total Total 27 1 3 1 0 0 2 1 32 3 Career total 90 18 4 2 2 0 4 1 100 21 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1969 births Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:English footballers Category:Men's association football forwards Category:Halesowen Town F.C. players Category:Hinckley United F.C. players Category:Living people Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Oxford United F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:English Football League players
