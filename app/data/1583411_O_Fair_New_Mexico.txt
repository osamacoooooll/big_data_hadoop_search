"The New Mexico State Song", NSTATE, LLC, December 2004, web: [http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/nm_o_fair_nm.htm Netstate-song-nm]. ==History== "O Fair New Mexico" was composed by Elizabeth Garrett, the daughter of former Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett, best known for killing the infamous outlaw Billy the Kid. It was copyrighted in 1915 as a guardia vieja-era tango. On March 14, 1917, the New Mexico legislature and then governor Washington E. Lindsey adopted the composition as the official state song of New Mexico. In 1924, Elizabeth Garrett made a recording of the song at Marsh Laboratories in Chicago, released on Marsh's Autograph Records label. In 1928, military conductor John Philip Sousa presented New Mexico governor Governor Arthur T. Hannett with a version of the song arranged as a march. Contemporary versions of the state song have been arranged with more of a New Mexico music style. ==Lyrics== The following are the lyrics for "O Fair New Mexico": ::;First verse :::Under a sky of azure, where balmy breezes blow, :::Kissed by the golden sunshine, is Nuevo México. :::Home of the Montezuma, with fiery hearts a glow, :::State of the deeds historic, is Nuevo México. ::;Chorus :::O fair New Mexico, we love, we love you so :::Our hearts with pride o'erflow , no matter where we go, :::O fair New Mexico, we love, we love you so, :::The grandest state to know, New Mexico. ::;Second verse :::Rugged and high sierras, with deep canyons below; :::Dotted with fertile valleys, is Nuevo México. :::Fields full of sweet alfalfa, richest perfumes bestow, :::State of the apple blossoms, is Nuevo México. ::;Chorus ::;Third verse :::Days that are full of heart-dreams, nights when the moon hangs low; :::Beaming its benediction, o'er Nuevo México. :::Land with its bright mañana, coming through weal and woe; :::State of our esperanza, is Nuevo México. ::;Chorus ==See also== *"Así Es Nuevo México", the Spanish state song ==External links== * University of New Mexico, University Libraries - Buckner collection of Elizabeth Garrett materials, 1893-1992 ==References== New Mexico Category:Music of New Mexico Category:Tangos Category:Spanish-language songs Category:1917 songs Category:Songs about New Mexico
