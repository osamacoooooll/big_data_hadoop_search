23171964	O the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus	"O the Deep Deep, Love of Jesus" is a well-known Christian hymn, written by the London merchant Samuel Trevor Francis. Francis (1834â€“1925) had a spiritual turning point as a teenager, contemplating suicide one night on a bridge over the River Thames. Experiencing a renewal of faith, he went on to author many poems and hymns and was a preacher in addition to his merchant career. The song compares Jesus' love to the ocean in scope, emphasizing the limitless, unchanging, and sacrificial nature of God's affections for the singer and all of humanity. It consists of three stanzas each utilizing an A, A, B, B rhyming structure. Various melodic and harmonic arrangements of the song have been published, the most common being a minor melody in 4/4 time. == Versions == * Beecher Hymn tune by John Zundel and Henry Ward Beecher * Pure Piano Panoramas (2000) by Jeff Bjorck.
