Like a sun, your proud flag must be An ardent symbol of faith and unity. May all your children, from North to South From East to West, be all love, May serving you be their only goal To fulfil their duty always. Dear Fatherland, cherished land, You are our one and true happiness. Our joy and our life To you, love and great honour. II You are the grave where our fathers sleep, The garden that our ancestors have cultivated. We work to make you prosperous One fine day we will finally get there. Be Africa's faithful child And always progress in peace Hoping that your young children Will love you without bounds forever. I O Cameroon, Thou Cradle of our Fathers, Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose, Their tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water, On thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose. Dear Fatherland, thy worth no tongue can tell! How can we ever pay thy due? Thy welfare we will win in toil and love and peace, Will be to thy name ever true! Land of Promise, land of Glory! Thou, of life and joy, our only store! Thine be honour, thine devotion, And deep endearment, for evermore. II From Shari, from where the Mungo meanders From along the banks of lowly Boumba Stream, Muster thy sons in union close around thee, Mighty as the Buea Mountain be their team; Instil in them the love of gentle ways, Regret for errors of the past; Foster, for Mother Africa, a loyalty That true shall remain to the last. === In local languages === The anthem has also been translated into several local languages. Ewondo lyrics === Former lyrics (1957–1970) === French lyrics English translation I O Cameroon, cradle of our ancestors, You once lived in barbarism, Like a sun, you start to appear, Little by little you come out of your savagery, May all your children, from North to South From East to West, be all love, May serving you be our only goal To fulfil their duty always. Dear Fatherland, dear land, You are our unique and true happiness. Our joy and our life To you, love and great honour. II You are the grave where our fathers sleep, The garden that our ancestors have cultivated. We work to make you prosperous One fine day we will finally get there. Be Africa's faithful child And always progress in peace Hoping that your young children Will love you without bounds forever. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Cameroon: O Cameroon, Cradle of Our Forefathers - Audio of the national anthem of Cameroon, with information and lyrics (archive link) * 'Chant de Ralliement'/'The Rallying Song' MIDI Category:National anthems Category:Cameroonian culture Category:African anthems Category:Compositions in B-flat major Category:1928 songs
