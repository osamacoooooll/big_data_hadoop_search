7047529	O'Byrne Cup	The Bord na Móna O'Byrne Cup is a Gaelic football competition organised by the Leinster GAA and first staged in 1954. The competition is named after Matt Byrne, a former Wicklow GAA club and county officer. By virtue of a quirk in translation, the Corn Uí Bhroin became known as the O'Byrne cup even though Matt had never used an 'O' in his surname. Byrne was born on February 14, 1870, was a native of Baltinglass and taught at the local national school on Chapel Hill. Deeply involved in GAA activities at any levels throughout his life, he was regarded as a good footballer in his youth as well as an excellent handballer. He was the first secretary of the Maurice Davins' club in Baltinglass and served as a member of the Wicklow County Board for over 50 years, mostly as county registrar. He was also his county's representative on Leinster and Central Councils and served as President of the Irish Handball Council from 1941-1944. He died on September 21, 1947. The competition participants are the eleven Leinster county teams (excluding Kilkenny). Formerly third-level teams competed, but from 2018 onward only county teams play. The competition is, together with the Walsh Cup and Kehoe Cup, part of the Bord na Móna Leinster GAA Series which takes place each January. The current O'Byrne Cup champions are Longford, who beat Louth in the 2023 final. The O'Byrne Shield was introduced for teams knocked out of the first stage of the Cup but was later abandoned in 2013 due to the introduction of group stages in the competition.The Bord Na Mona O'Byrne Cup S.F. 2013 Friday night lights on cards for Leinster championship showdowns - Independent.ie ==Top winners== Team Wins Years won 1 border Kildare 11 1962, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1976, 1982, 1989, 2003, 2011, 2013, 2014 2 border Dublin 10 1956, 1958, 1960, 1966, 1999, 2007, 2008, 2015, 2017, 2022 border Meath 10 1967, 1974, 1977, 1983, 1992, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2016, 2018 4 border Offaly 6 1954, 1961, 1981, 1993, 1997, 1998 5 border Laois 5 1978, 1987, 1991, 1994, 2005 6 border Longford 4 1965, 2000, 2020, 2023 border Westmeath 4 1959, 1980, 1988, 2019 border Louth 4 1963, 1980, 1990, 2009 border Wicklow 4 1955, 1957, 1986, 1996 10 border DCU 2 2010, 2012 11 border Carlow 1 2002 border Wexford 1 1995 ==Previous finals== *Wexford awarded title as Westmeath refused to play extra time ==The O'Byrne Shield== The O'Byrne Shield was an inter county competition between the losers of the first round of the O'Byrne Cup.
