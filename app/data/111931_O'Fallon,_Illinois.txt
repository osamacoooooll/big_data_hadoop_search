111931	O'Fallon, Illinois	O'Fallon is a city in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. The 2020 census listed the population at 32,289. The city is the second largest city in the Metro-East region and Southern Illinois. It sits from Scott Air Force Base and from Downtown St Louis. Like its namesake in St. Charles County, Missouri, O'Fallon is part of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. This makes O'Fallon (along with the two Troys in Illinois and Missouri) one of the few pairs of like-named municipalities to be part of the same MSA. ==History== Founded in 1854, O'Fallon's namesake comes from Colonel John O'Fallon who was a wealthy gentleman from St. Louis. In downtown O'Fallon, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad railroad depot was built, which helped put O'Fallon on the map. City lots were platted and sold at a public auction on May 18, 1854. A post office was established the following year and the city began attracting German settlers looking for fertile farming land. On January 27, 1874, O'Fallon was incorporated as a village. On March 14, 1905, the citizens voted for a change to the city form of government. Since its founding, O'Fallon has gained population every decennial census year except 1930, when the census showed a net loss of six residents. right|thumb|Tornado damage, 2006 The city center is approximately two miles east of the intersection of Interstate 64 and U.S. Route 50. Suburban growth in O'Fallon expanded considerably during the 1980s and following the expansion of Interstate 64 in the 1990s. Subdivisions include Thornbury Hill, Nolin Creek Estates, Fairwood Hills, Deer Creek, Forest Hills, and Fairwood East. O'Fallon Township High School's main campus at 600 South Smiley Street has undergone numerous additions over the past decades to ease overcrowding, including the creation of the separate 9th Grade Milburn Campus. O'Fallon's city seal was designed in 1974 by Michael Donovan, an OTHS freshman, during a contest held by the O'Fallon Junior Woman's Club to create a city flag. In May 1975, the design was finalized by Louis Bradshaw and was then adopted by the city as its official flag. According to the 2004 publication by the O'Fallon Historical Society, O'Fallon Sesquicentennial History: > "The design is yellow gold on a blue background—the colors of the high > school. The pick and shovel represent the coal mines that were so important > to O'Fallon's economy for over 100 years. The locomotive represents the > railroad to which O'Fallon owes its existence. The planes represent Scott > Air Force Base where many in O'Fallon find employment—both military and > civil service." ===Events=== * Tornado outbreak of April 2, 2006 ==Annual events== * May - Memorial Day To Honor Those Who Gave their lives in service of the nation (O'Fallon Veterans Monument) * November – Veterans Day Celebration at O'Fallon Veterans Monument; Veterans Day Parade - largest in the area * November, the Saturday after Thanksgiving - Lighted Holiday Parade ==Parks and public services== thumb|Rock Springs Nature Park thumb|Public Library O'Fallon Parks and Recreation * Family Sports Park * Hesse Park * Katy Cavin's Community Center * O'Fallon Community Park * O'Fallon Memorial Pool * Rock Springs Nature Park ** Nature center ** Jogging/cycling paths ** Nature trails ** Natural prairie ** Dog Park * MCT Goshen Trailhead * St. Clair Recreation Complex * St. Ellen Mine Park * Thoman Park * Veteran's Monument Library * O'Fallon Public Library Registered historic places * Scott Field Historic District ==Schools== thumb|Delores Moye School * O'Fallon Community Consolidated School District #90 ** Delores Moye Elementary School ** Estelle Kampmeyer Elementary School ** J.
