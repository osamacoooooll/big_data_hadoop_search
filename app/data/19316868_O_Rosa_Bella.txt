19316868	O Rosa Bella	"O rosa bella" is the title of two popular 15th century chansons, the earlier composed by Johannes Ciconia and the latter originally attributed to John Dunstaple, but now to John Bedyngham . The text is based on a poem written by Leonardo Giustiniani (1388–1446). The text of the first verse is: :O rosa bella, :O dolce anima mia :Non mi lassar morire :In cortesia, in cortesia. Stanley Sadie in the Cambridge Music Guide gives as translation: :O lovely rose :My sweet soul :Let me not die :In courtly love The chanson was used as a basis for several other works, including that by Johannes Ockeghem, and masses attributed to Gilles Joye; however, Johannes Ciconia's early version shares the words but not the tune . ==Recordings== * O rosa bella: English and Continental Music from the Late Gothic Period: Clemencic Consort / René Clemencic (Arte Nova 59210) ==References== * * ==External links== * Midi and nwc2 versions with text on the ChoralWiki site. * Enzyklopædia super O rosa bella by composer Karlheinz Essl (1995) Category:Renaissance chansons Category:Medieval compositions
