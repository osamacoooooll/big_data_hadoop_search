27526313	O'Carroll baronets	The O'Carroll baronetcy, of Denton, Yorkshire, was a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain that was apparently created in or before 1712 for the military commander Daniel O'Carroll, although there is no official record of its creation. The first baronet later became a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. The fourth baronet was British Resident at Saxe-Weimar. The title became either extinct or dormant on the death of the sixth baronet in 1835.Cokayne, George Edward (1906) Complete Baronetage. Volume V. Exeter: W.
