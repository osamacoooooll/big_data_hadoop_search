Alice (Sara Matos) wants Ritas life. Rita (Dalila Carmo) wants to bring Alice into the happy family life she built with her husband Fernando (Pedro Lima), unaware that her sister is truly an evil monster who will stop at nothing to take Ritas place. In the cosmopolitan and sophisticated city of Lisbon, we watch as the stories of common people intersect, as they face everyday tribulations, fighting and trying to overcome them, in a plot filled with emotion and sensuality, in which evil is depicted in all its rawness and in which we see how that evil can ruin those who aren’t ready to face their enemies, no matter where they come from... And, sometimes, your worst enemy is yourself or those to whom you call your family... ==Cast== ===Main=== * Sara Matos – Alice Vidal * Dalila Carmo – Rita Macieira * Pedro Lima – Fernando Macieira * Pedro Teixeira – Rafael Pires – «Rafa» ===Secondary=== * Natália Luiza – Adelaide Maria Correia Vidal * Nuno Homem de Sá – António Furtado * Ana Brito e Cunha – Alexandra Furtado – «Xana» * Marco Delgado – Romão Valente de Albuquerque * Sandra Faleiro – Natália de Albuquerque * Maria José Paschoal – Conceição Pires * Joana Seixas – Teresa Furtado * Rui Luís Brás – Marco Santos * Sofia Nicholson – Ana Santos * Paula Neves – Vera Ramos * Rodrigo Menezes – Nuno Ramos * Dinarte Branco – Hilário Castelo * Pedro Carvalho – Paulo Furtado from Macieira * Patricia André – Isabel de Albuquerque – «Becas» * Renato Godinho – Manuel Ventura * Duarte Gomes – Miguel Macieira * Madalena Brandão – Marta Ventura * Isaac Alfaiate – Ricardo de Albuquerque * Joana Câncio – Tina Castelo * Rodrigo Paganelli – André Macieira * Mikaela Lupu – Maria Santos * Gonçalo Sá – Frederico Santos * Mafalda Tavares – Carlota Furtado * Luís Ganito – Duarte Macieira * Nicolau Breyner – Henrique de Albuquerque * Lídia Franco – Madalena de Albuquerque * Margarida Marinho – Rosalinda Castelo * Diogo Infante – Afonso Gonçalves ===Children=== * Daniela Marques – Beatriz Ventura * Francisco Magalhães – Martim Ramos ==References== Category:Televisão Independente telenovelas Category:2014 Portuguese television series debuts Category:2014 Portuguese television series endings Category:2014 telenovelas Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas
