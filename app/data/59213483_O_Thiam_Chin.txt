Many of his stories explore themes of heartbreak and gay male sexuality. == Biography == O was born into a family of Mandarin-speaking hawkers. He studied English and literature at Ang Mo Kio Secondary School, but only barely passed these subjects in his O-Level examinations. Unsure of his future career prospects, he pursued a diploma in mechatronics at Temasek Polytechnic. During National Service, he began to read authors such as Raymond Carver and Banana Yoshimoto, whom he still regards as great influences. Later, he worked in a telecommunications company, then joined Mediacorp as a marketing and communications executive. In 2000, he took up a part-time course in English language and literature at the Singapore Institute of Management. This experience inspired him to begin writing fiction. After this, he began writing for magazines and online media, even writing and directing a short film. He became a full-time writer in 2005, and self-published his first collection, Free-Falling Man, in 2006. He has been featured three times on the longlist of the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award: in 2010 for Never Been Better, in 2012 for The Rest of Your Life and Everything That Comes with It, and in 2014 for Love, or Something like Love. His stories have also been featured in numerous journals, such as Asia Literary Review, Kyoto Journal, The Jakarta Post, Cha: An Asian Literary Journal, the Quarterly Literary Review Singapore, Karavan, and Asia Writes. His debut novel, Now That It's Over, explores the heartbreak and trauma of two Singaporean couples, one gay and one straight, before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It was the winner of the inaugural Epigram Books Fiction Prize in 2015. His second novel, Fox Fire Girl, looks at a mysterious young woman and the self-destructive men who love her.
