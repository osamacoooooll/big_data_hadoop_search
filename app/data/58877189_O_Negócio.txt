[and] the series was successful to explore its main theme in the prism of humor." He noted that "even with so many qualities, O Negócio did not escape a depletion of the formula. Therefore, the decision to finish the series at the fourth season was quite happy.", and concluded that "The story was closed at the right time, showing that the Brazilian series production on pay TV has already raised to high levels, and that the Brazilian Teledramaturgy, in general, has many paths to follow." BuzzFeed published a list of their 26 non-American favorite TV shows and O Négocio was the only Brazilian production listed. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2018 Brazilian television series endings Category:2010s Brazilian television series Category:Brazilian drama television series Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:HBO Latin America original programming Category:Prostitution in Brazilian television Category:Television shows filmed in São Paulo (state) Category:Television shows set in São Paulo Category:Portuguese-language HBO original programming
