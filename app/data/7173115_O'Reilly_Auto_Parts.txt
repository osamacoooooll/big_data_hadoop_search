7173115	O'Reilly Auto Parts	O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. is an American auto parts retailer that provides automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories to professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers. Founded in 1957 by the O’Reilly family, the company operates more than 5,600 stores in 47 states and Mexico. ==History== Michael Byrne O’Reilly immigrated to America in 1849. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O’Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis. By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O’Reilly, joined the company. Together they helped make Link Motor Supply the predominant auto parts store in the area. In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O’Reilly, and the transfer of Chub O’Reilly to Kansas City. The two made the decision to form their own company, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business in Springfield, Missouri on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958—their first full year of business. By 1961, the company's volume had reached $1.3 million in combined sales volume of O’Reilly Automotive and their Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility was built for the O’Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwestern Missouri. As of March 2021, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. operated more than 5,600 stores in 47 states, including Alaska and Hawaii and Mexico. On April 23, 1993, the company completed an initial public stock offering, and since then trades on the NASDAQ market under the symbol ORLY. The company offers a stock purchase plan to employees in order to enable as many full-time team members as possible stock ownership in the company. ==Expansion== ===Mergers and acquisitions=== On January 30, 1998, O'Reilly merged with Hi/LO Auto Supply, adding 182 auto parts stores in Texas and Louisiana, as well as a distribution center in Houston.Elder, Laura (December 28, 1997) Rejecting Discount: Hi-Lo finds new buyer for its retail operation Houston Business Journal The Hi/LO acquisition made O’Reilly one of the top 10 auto parts chains in the country.
