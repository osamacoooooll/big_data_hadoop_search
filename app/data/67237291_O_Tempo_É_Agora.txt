Paulo said "it's curious to notice how the innocence was lost. They're still Anavitória, more optimistic than any other thing, but their songs now suffer. Because not everything is about flowers, bare feet and filled beds, after all". He also thought Ana Caetano was now a better composer and did not put too much weight on the metaphors, dealing with senses and feelings". Robson Gomes, from Jornal do Commercio, said "musically speaking, little has changed since the 2016 debut album and O Tempo é Agora. But the more recent work is marked by the maturing of lyrics and their evolution as artists." Mauro Ferreira, from G1, said "Anavitória's sound has been being ground on the show business machine. (...) The album O tempo é agora is the result of this urgency in explore the moment and exhaust a success formula that, perhaps, won't be so effective in the market". He also believes that this supposed commercial exploit impacted in the duo's music. "What sounded natural in the 2016 album (...) already seems artificial in the current one (...). He ended his review saying that "if everything – sold out shows, hundreds of views in video platforms, the fans fervor – is gone in a probably still distant future, Anavitória might still resist in the scene due to the essence that the music industry cannot grind to the full in the albumO tempo é agora." O Tempo É Agora was ranked as the 37th best Brazilian album of 2018 by Rolling Stone Brasil. === Accolades === Year Award Category Outcome Ref. 2019 Latin Grammy Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album THE LATIN ACADEMY OF RECORDING ARTS & SCIENCES, INC. - 20th Latin GRAMMY® Awards - FINAL NOMINATIONS === Certifications === == Track listing == The standard edition of the album contains eleven tracks. == Promotion == === O Tempo É Agora Tour === Following the end of the tour with Nando Reis in July 2018, it was announced that a semi-fictional movie featuring the duo as protagonists would be released in August, named Ana e Vitória.Anavitória vive amor livre em filme sobre história da dupla: "É como enxergamos" The album was announced on the same day.Anavitória lança novo álbum 'O tempo é agora' On 18 December 2020, the duo released the show in a film format, titled O Tempo É Agora: Ao Vivo na Fundição.Anavitória libera apresentações do show “O Tempo É Agora (Ao Vivo na Fundição)” Yahoo. 18 December 2020. retrieved on 14 January 2021 == Personnel == * Ana Caetano — lead vocals * Vitória Falcão — lead vocals * Mike Tulio — volead vocals * Jamie Wollam — drums * Sean Hurley — bass * Tim Pierce — guitars * Roberto Pollo — keyboards * Jamie Muhoberac — keyboards * Recording engineer — Moogie Canazio * Recording assistants — Matt Wolach, Bo Bodnar, June Murakawa, Daniel Pampury * Digital editing — Moogie Canazio * Musical production — Tiago Iorc and Moogie Canazio * Executive production and direction — Felipe Simas * A&R; direction — Miguel Cariello * A&R; manager — Miguel Afonso * A&R; coordination — Igor Alarcon, Marina Furtado, Patricia Aidas, Clarice Carrilho * Label manager — Bárbara Cotta * Production manager — Isadora Silveira == Certifications == == References == Category:Anavitória albums Category:2018 albums Category:Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album Category:Portuguese- language albums
