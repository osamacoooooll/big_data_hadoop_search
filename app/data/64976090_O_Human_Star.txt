O Human Star began publication in 2012 and concluded in August 2020. == Reviews == Polygon reviewer Samantha Riedel called O Human Star "the best robot comic in a decade", saying that it "delves into complex themes of gender and the need to belong" and calling it "one of the most sociopolitically relevant works of the past ten years". Writing for the DiNKY Awards, DiNKY director Ted Intorcio said "In addition to being a wonderful love story for these men, it challenges the reader’s perceptions of what “normal” looks like... OHS explores LGBTQ issues in a very sensitive way without having this context / subtext overpower the story... Blue's Manga- influenced style is more than competent and complements the tone of the story nicely. I can't recommend this book enough for anyone who likes great stories with rich context and tons of applicability." == Awards == |- ! scope="row" | 2018 | Webcomics Category | Prism Awards | | For excerpts of O Human Star from 2017 | |- ! scope="row" | 2016 | Best in Show | DiNKY Awards | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2016 | Best Work - Self Published | DiNKY Awards | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2016 | Outstanding Work – Diversity | DiNKY Awards | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2015 | Outstanding Online Comic | Ignatz Award | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2015 | LGBT Graphic Novel | Lambda Literary Award | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2014 | Favorite Webcomic (Continuing Story) | Autostraddle | | | |- ! scope="row" | 2012 | Queer Press Grant | Prism Comics | | | == External links == == References == Category:Science fiction webcomics Category:2010s webcomics Category:LGBT-related webcomics Category:LGBT speculative fiction Category:Transgender-related comics Category:LGBT-related graphic novels Category:Robots in literature
