Their title is The O'Grady in English and Ó Gráda in Irish. ==Naming conventions== Male Daughter Wife (Long) Wife (Short) Ó Grádaigh Ní Ghrádaigh Bean Uí Ghrádaigh Uí Ghrádaigh Ó Gráda Ní Ghráda Bean Uí Ghráda Uí Ghráda ==History== They belong to the Dál gCais kindred and are distant cousins to the O'Brien dynasty, but have since the Middle Ages been based not in County Clare, from where they originated, but in County Limerick. The seat of the family, Kilballyowen, is near the town of Bruff. The name Standish was often used by the family; it derives from the marriage in 1633 of Darby O'Grady, The O'Grady, to Faith Standish. Some of the O'Grady family converted to the Church of Ireland (Anglican Communion) and produced a Bishop of Meath, Hugh Brady. The family also produced some prominent historians such as Standish Hayes O'Grady and Standish James O'Grady. The now extinct title in the peerage of Ireland, the Viscount Guillamore, was held by the family. ==See also== * List of people with surname O'Grady ==References== * Burke, Bernard and Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, Burke's Irish Family Records.
