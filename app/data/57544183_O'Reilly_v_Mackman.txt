57544183	O'Reilly v Mackman	O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] UKHL 1 is a UK constitutional law case, concerning judicial review. ==Facts== Convicted prisoners claimed that a decision that they lost remission of their sentences, after a riot in Hull prison, was null and void because of breaches of natural justice, as seen in St Germain [1979] QB 425.

There was a requirement to be prompt. ==Judgment== ===Court of Appeal=== Lord Denning MR and the Court of Appeal held that it would be an abuse of process to allow a claim through judicial review.[1983] 2 AC 237, 255 ===House of Lords=== The House of Lords held that the prisoners had to make a claim through judicial review, not for breach of statutory duty. The court had jurisdiction to grant the declarations, but the prisoners’ case was solely a claim based on public law. Order 53 (now CPR Part 54) protected public authorities from groundless or delayed attacks by its requirements, so it would be wrong to allow evasion of its limits.
