They were displaced from the Mallow area of Cork in confiscations during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 1650s when they lost , 20,000 of which was deemed to have been the property of the ruling chief, Donncha O'Callaghan. He and his extended family were transplanted to east Clare, where they obtained land in the barony of Tulla Lower. The village of O'Callaghan's Mills records their continued presence. ===Parish history=== There is a tradition that two priests of the Congregation of the Mission, or Vincentians, escaped from the 1651 siege of Limerick by Oliver Cromwell's troops, and for several years ministered to the people of the parish near the present church of St Vincent de Paul in Oatfield. The foundation stone of the present church of St Patrick at O'Callaghan's Mills was laid in March 1839. It was dedicated in March 1840. Major renovations were undertaken in 1979-80. The first church in the old Clonlea part of the parish was probably built at Kilkishen very early in the 19th century. It is mentioned in an 1811 report of a dispute that led to violence over who should sit nearest to the altar. Major renovation or reconstruction was completed in 1865. The St Vincent de Paul church was built around 1830, replacing a thatched chapel. The roof was blown away in January 1839 on the Night of the Big Wind. The building was then enlarged, with the addition of two transepts. In May 1966 Bishop Joseph Rodgers rededicated the church. ==Sport== O'Callaghan Mills GAA club has won the Clare county hurling championship on eight occasions.
