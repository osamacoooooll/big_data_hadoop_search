[It has] as many mistakes as the correct ones." == See also == * List of Brazilian films of the 1990s == References == == External links == * Category:Os Trapalhões Category:Brazilian adventure films Category:Brazilian children's films Category:1990 films Category:Brazilian romantic comedy films Category:Robin Hood films Category:Robin Hood parodies Category:1990s musical comedy films Category:1990 comedy films Category:1990s Portuguese-language films
