Their gas ranges and stand-alone ovens were particularly popular in Southern California in the middle of the 20th Century. == History == O'Keefe and Merritt Manufacturing Company began operations in Los Angeles in 1920.p. 780 In 1950, Tappan purchased the company in a $5 million transaction, but management remained in Los Angeles and the company continued to produce 500-600 ranges each day. p. 22. p. 127. The reputation for high quality that the company enjoyed is shown by the December 1951 purchase by Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame of an Aristocrat for his wife, which he had shipped from Los Angeles by air. The company brand also appeared on microwave ovens, which were manufactured by Litton. In 1970, the company faced labor issues, but Tappan claimed they had been largely resolved by October of that year. == Features == Stove features included the "Grillevator," designed for broiling large items like hams or turkeys. The Automatic Burner Control (A.B.C.) allowed chefs to set the burners to turn off after a particular amount of time. The large Aristocrat model featured three ovens and two broilers, weighing 734 pounds. p. 13. In 1960, a built-in barbecue unit could be added to a cooktop. By 1964, all O'Keefe and Merritt electric ovens had built-in clocks that could be used to turn on the oven, cook for a certain time, and then turn off the oven. In 1965, O'Keefe and Merritt sold, among other models, a 36-inch range and a 21 inch wide oven. The deluxe versions of these products included a warming feature which kept food at 170 degrees until serving. In 1967, the company sold Teflon coated ovens. The 1962 built-in dishwasher featured an "alternating roller impeller" designed to better distribute water throughout the machine. ==See also== * List of stoves ==References== Category:Stoves
