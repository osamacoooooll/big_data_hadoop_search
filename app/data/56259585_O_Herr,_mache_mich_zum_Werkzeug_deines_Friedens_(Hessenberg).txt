56259585	O Herr, mache mich zum Werkzeug deines Friedens (Hessenberg)	"O Herr, mache mich zum Werkzeug deines Friedens" (O lord, make me an instrument of your peace), Op. 37/1, is a motet by Kurt Hessenberg for a six- part mixed choir a cappella, composed in 1946. It is a setting of a prayer which the composer took for a work by Francis of Assisi at the time of the composition, therefore it was subtitled "Motette nach Worten des Franz von Assisiâ€œ (Motet after words by Francis of Assisi). He understood later that the famous prayer is much younger. The motet was first performed in Essen-Werden in 1948. It was published by Schott. == References == == External links == * O Herr, mache mich zum Werkzeug deines Friedens kurthessenberg.de Category:Motets Category:1946 compositions
