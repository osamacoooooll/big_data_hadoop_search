It formed part of the Wandong to Bendigo line, and was commissioned as part of the Railway Construction Act 821, which authorised large amounts of railway infrastructure to be built. At the time, Heathcote had a population of 1500, and was part of the supply chain for the gold rush. From 1888 for several decades, the railway was kept busy supplying timber for mine shafts, and as fuel. At its peak, two trainloads of timber was transported each day. However, by 1958, this had dwindled to less than a trainload of freight per week, and the service was suspended. The track was finally dismantled in the 1970s. thumb|600px|center|Map of the rail trail, as at September 2013. ==References== ==External links== * ==Sources== *O'Keefe Rail Trail â€“ Updates *O'Keefe Rail Trail *"O'Keefe Rail Trail", City of Greater Bendigo, 2000. *Friends of the Bendigo-Kilmore Rail Trail Category:Rail trails in Victoria (state)
