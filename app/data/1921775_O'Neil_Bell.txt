1921775	O'Neil Bell	O'Neil Bell (29 December 1974 – 25 November 2015) was a Jamaican professional boxer who competed from 1998 to 2011. He held the undisputed cruiserweight title in 2006 and the lineal cruiserweight title from 2006 to 2007. ==Professional career== Bell lost his second fight against Algerian amateur star (M. Benguesima) but kept winning for years after that. He defeated former IBF champion Arthur Williams twice by KO and climbed the rankings. He defeated Canadian Dale Brown in a controversial but unanimous decision on May 20, 2005, on Friday Night Fights to capture the vacant IBF title. He unified the title by beating Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck on January 7, 2006, for his WBA and WBC belts, making Bell the second undisputed champion of the division, with Evander Holyfield being the first. The IBF later stripped Bell in April 2006 for pulling out of a mandatory bout against Steve Cunningham because of a tooth problem. After nearly 11 months of inactivity, Bell was due to take part in the postponed Superfighter Tournament at heavyweight on December 1 of that year. Bell lost the WBA, WBC and lineal cruiserweight titles to Jean-Marc Mormeck on March 17, 2007 in the Frenchman's backyard in Levallois, France via a close but unanimous decision. On April 19, 2008, in Poland, Bell fought former WBC light heavyweight champion Tomasz Adamek. Bell was dropped in the first round and quit after the end of round seven, complaining of feeling dizzy and sick. After the Adamek fight, Bell announced his move to the heavyweight division, saying that making the cruiserweight limit sapped his strength for his last two fights. Bell's first heavyweight bout was scheduled to be against Willie Palms on January 14, 2009, but that fight never occurred. ==Professional boxing record== Result Record Opponent Type Round, time Date Location Notes 32 Win 27–4–1 Rico Cason TKO 1, 17 Dec 2011 31 Loss 26–4–1 Richard Hall TKO 2 (10), 4 Jun 2011 30 Loss 26–3–1 Tomasz Adamek TKO 8 (12) 19 Apr 2008 29 Loss 26–2–1 Jean-Marc Mormeck UD 12 17 Mar 2007 28 Win 26–1–1 Jean-Marc Mormeck KO 10 (12), 7 Jan 2006 27 Win 25–1–1 Sebastiaan Rothmann KO 11 (12), 26 Aug 2005 26 Win 24–1–1 Dale Brown UD 12 20 May 2005 25 Win 23–1–1 Ezra Sellers KO 2 (12), 4 Sep 2004 24 Win 22–1–1 Derrick Harmon TKO 8 (12), 19 Dec 2003 23 Win 21–1–1 Kelvin Davis TKO 11 (12), 23 May 2003 22 Win 20–1–1 Arthur Williams TKO 9 (12), 8 Nov 2002 21 Win 19–1–1 Eric Davis TKO 3 (6) 28 Jun 2002 20 Draw 18–1–1 Ernest Mateen 3 (10) 26 Apr 2002 19 Win 18–1 Ka-Dy King TKO 3 (10) 9 Apr 2002 18 Win 17–1 Arthur Williams TKO 11 (12), 7 Sep 2001 17 Win 16–1 Jason Robinson 10 3 Jul 2001 16 Win 15–1 Jose Luis Rivera TKO 11 (12) 10 May 2001 15 Win 14–1 James Walton TKO 10 (12), 18 Jan 2001 14 Win 13–1 Michael Rush KO 5 (12) 19 Oct 2000 13 Win 12–1 Eric Davis TKO 2 (10) 13 Oct 2000 12 Win 11–1 Jose Hiram Torres TKO 3 2 Jun 2000 11 Win 10–1 John Moore TKO 3 22 Apr 2000 10 Win 9–1 Wes Taylor TKO 3 27 Jan 2000 9 Win 8–1 George Holder TKO 2 (6), 3 Sep 1999 8 Win 7–1 Carl Handy TKO 4 11 Aug 1999 7 Win 6–1 John Battle KO 2 3 Mar 1999 6 Win 5–1 Cliff Nellon TKO 4 (6), 22 Jan 1999 5 Win 4–1 John Carter TKO 1 (4), 13 Nov 1998 4 Win 3–1 Larry Donnell TKO 2 30 Jul 1998 3 Win 2–1 James Sealey KO 1 26 Jun 1998 2 Loss 1–1 Mahamed Benguesmia 4 (6) 11 Apr 1998 1 Win 1–0 William Holyfield 1 (4) 19 Feb 1998 ==Outside the ring== On February 5, 2007, Bell allegedly threw an axe at his sparring partner, Larry Slayton, while training in the woods of Big Bear, California.
