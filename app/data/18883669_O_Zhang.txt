It was in Beijing that Zhang discovered photography, yet to her dismay the Central Academy did not have a photography department. Thus, Zhang taught herself photography technique after hours when she often snuck into the school studios with models in order to shoot.WPS1, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Centerspeech: hear the actual speech, (http://www.wps1.org/new_site/content/view/2213/), or read a transcribed version, (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) For her first series, Masterpieces in my Eyes, Zhang projected images of Western figurative masterpieces on nude female models and photographed them in an effort to impose, “the male standards of female form” upon the models.Article titled “O Zhang in Transit” by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky in Yishu Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art Fall issue, 2004 (http://www.yishujournal.com/06/arch_3_3_04.htm) Zhang graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2000. ===United Kingdom: London=== Zhang states that after graduating from the Central Academy she, “wanted to go abroad to see the outside world,” so she moved to London to study at the Byam Shaw School of Art and made two new series, Water Moon (2001–02) and Black Hair.WPS1, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center speech: hear the actual speech, (http://www.wps1.org/new_site/content/view/2213/), or read a transcribed version, (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) For Water Moon, Zhang employed the same method used in Masterpieces in my Eyes, however, she projected Ming dynasty erotic paintings, which were outlawed in China, on faceless models.Zhang’s Water Moon artist statement (http://web.mac.com/zhang_o/iWeb/Site/O%20Zhang,%20W-Statement.html) For Black Hair, Zhang photographed the wet hair of Asian women arranged in brush-like “strokes” on their backs, mimicking Chinese characters. One critic writes of the series, “The hair represents a significant and lasting genetic trait of Asian women and is therefore a symbol of survival, and Chinese writing is still a lasting tradition, yet both are out of context, the writing is not on paper and the woman is in a Western tub”.Article titled “O Zhang in Transit” by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky in Yishu Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art Fall issue, 2004 (http://www.yishujournal.com/06/arch_3_3_04.htm) Zhang received her second MA in London at The Royal College of Art where she began to plan her next project that would involve her returning to China, Horizon (2004).CRG Gallery Artist Biography (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) ==Major projects== ===Horizon=== Zhang's inspiration for Horizon came from the Chinese Cultural Revolution slogan, “rebellion is the rule.”Quoted on CRG Gallery works page (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/work/) Her goal was to produce a series of images that question current assumptions about the primacy of western power.Zhang’s Horizon artist statement (http://web.mac.com/zhang_o/iWeb/Site/O%20Zhang,%20H-Statement.html) The installation consists of a three row grid of photographs: on the top young Chinese girls squat on the hill looking down to the viewer, in the middle row's girls eyes are at the viewer's eye level and in the bottom row the girls are placed in a field of grass and look up to the viewer. The positioning of the horizon-line is consistent from photo to photo so that throughout each row the images merge to become one larger landscape.Discussed on CRG Gallery works page (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/work/) London critic JJ Charlesworth writes of the series: ::O Zhang photographs small Chinese girls as they crouch down and stare back at the camera. Dominating the frame and the spectator, Zhang's little subjects offer oddly sinister and uncomprehending expressions. The West's self-conscious fascination with contemporary China reverberates through Zhang’s portraits, which co-opt the brand-logo myth of childhood innocence and global harmony, making her endearing subjects alien, monstrous and threatening.New York Arts Magazine, 2008 (http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=276591) ===Daddy and I=== Zhang's next series, Daddy and I, concerns itself with adolescent adopted Chinese girls and their adoptive American Caucasian fathers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Oregon.Zhang's Daddy and I artist statement (http://web.mac.com/zhang_o/iWeb/Site/O%20Zhang,%20D-Statement.html) Since 1991, when China loosened its adoption law, American families have adopted more than 55,000 Chinese children, almost all girls.Statistics from AdoptiveFamilies.com (http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/china_adoption.php) Zhang, in a speech given on WPS1 Art Radio, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center on March 27 of 2008, discusses what questions motivated her to move forward with the Daddy and I project. She states: ::By photographing adopted Chinese girls and their Western fathers in America, I try to capture the affection between a female child and an adult male. What is the nature of this complex relationship, especially when different ethnic and cultural backgrounds are introduced? … Through the relationship of the emerging feminine power of the adolescent girl to the mature father, each image explores the unfathomable relation of the two inseparable, yet often divided cultures: East and West.WPS1, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center speech: hear the actual speech, (http://www.wps1.org/new_site/content/view/2213/), or read a transcribed version, (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) ====Criticisms==== Some critics see the works as manipulative and claim that the girls look like “Thai Lolitas,” while others argue that it is necessary to realize that the work feeds into common stereotypes and concepts of political correctness, thus making the images more than they are and asking the viewer not to submit their interpretations to stereotypes."The Guide." 19 November 2005. ===The World is Yours (But Also Ours)=== Zhang's project, The World is Yours (But Also Ours), completed in July–August 2008, was shown at the Frieze Art Fair 2008 and the CRG Gallery, NY in December 2008. The images depict Chinese youth wearing American style tee-shirts featuring "Chinglish" statements and bordered with Chinese Cultural Revolution -era propaganda slogans. In doing so the series visually captures conflicts in modern-day Chinese culture, such as communist legacy vs. recent rapid economic development and traditional culture vs. western popular culture, thus encapsulating the identity crisis facing Chinese youth and modern China.Zhang's The World is Yours (But Also Ours) artist statement (http://web.mac.com/zhang_o/iWeb/Site/O%20Zhang-World- statement.html) ===Recent projects=== Zhang's book (in Chinese) that documents her experiences as a Chinese art student living in London titled, An Empire Where The Moon Light Never Fades was published by Shanghai Art and Literature Publishing House in January 2009 Cutting the Blaze to New Frontiers marks the 70th anniversary of the 1939-40 New York World's Fair. The project harkens back to its inspirational theme “the Dawn of a New Day” against the backdrop of today's financial crisis. The artist assembled a miniature fair in collaboration with a group of Queens youth of immigrant parents. Having never visited their parents’ countries of origin, the young participants imagined their own “motherland” as a national pavilion. Her mini-Fair reflects the increasingly complex cultural demographics of Queens and its inimitable vigor as the future of the nation. The project was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Queens Museum of Art Zhang was commissioned by Chinatown Art Space and Royal Opera House in London to make a short film about Anna May Wong (1905–61), the first Asian-American actress who gained a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Of Anna And Dreams is a modern and artistic interpretation of her three dreams exploring three themes in her life: Fear, Identity Complex and Lust for Love. ==Awards== Zhang is a participant in the Artists Residency Program at Queens Museum of Art, New York and is the recipient of fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, The MacDowell Colony, and the Wilson Centre for Photography. She was awarded the Fuji Film Student Award and The Royal College of Photography Graduate Award and was nominated/short-listed for The Chinese Contemporary Art Award, Beck's Futures Award, The Creative Capital Awards and The Louis Comfort Biennial Award.CRG Gallery Artist Biography (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) Zhang was the first student from mainland China to receive the Royal College of Art MA Photography degree which requires an approval honor by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.CRG Gallery Artist Biography (http://www.crggallery.com/artists/o-zhang/bio/) ==Public collections== *Solomon R.
