It was self-released on May 17, 2018,Rogério Skylab - O Rei do Cu and sees Skylab returning to the experimental and eclectic sonority he had previously developed in his 1999–2011 Skylab series of 10 albums and abandoned in his then-most recent "Trilogia dos Carnavais" (2012–2015). It can be downloaded for free in the musician's official website, and is also available for streaming. ==Background== According to Skylab, the album's name (and the trilogy it is part of) was inspired by a controversial statement given by fellow musician Lulu Santos in late December 2017, in which he stated "MPB was de-evolving into its 'anal phase'", alluding to the then-recently released music video for Anitta's "Vai Malandra". Indirectly criticizing the statement, Skylab then replied that, "to affirm this tendency, [his] next album would have ass everywhere". On March 7, 2018, Skylab announced on his Facebook page that he already began working on such album, and that it would be called O Rei do Cu. On the same post, he also said that it would be the first installment of a new trilogy, the "Trilogia do Cu".Rogério Skylab - Facebook (March 7, 2018) On April 2, 2018, Skylab uploaded to his SoundCloud page a brief teaser of one of the tracks that would be featured on the album, "Dedo no Cu e Gritaria",Rogério Skylab - Dedo no Cu e Gritaria which was inspired by an obscure Internet meme originated in Brazilian shitposting communities.
