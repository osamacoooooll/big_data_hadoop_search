Starting with neoclassical-style clarity, he builds textured, complex musical structures that sound old and new at the same time, and his skillful text settings use minimalist-like repetition to give Mr. Vavrek’s pointed, thoughtful words even more power and emotional specificity." ==References== Category:2015 operas Category:English-language operas Category:Operas Category:Operas set in the United States Category:Operas set in the 16th century Category:Cultural depictions of astronauts Category:Cultural depictions of Walter Raleigh Category:Operas based on real people Category:Operas set in the 20th century
