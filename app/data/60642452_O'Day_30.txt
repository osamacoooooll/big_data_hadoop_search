She’s not really a racer, but she will stay up with almost any boat of her size and type, and is easy to handle, to boot." The review conclude4d, "With her good performance and big interior, the O'Day 30 makes a reasonable coastal cruising boat. This is a low-maintenance boat, with little exterior wood. Along with low maintenance, you get pretty plain-Jane appearance. The boat still looks modern. If she appeared in a boat show today, she wouldn’t look dated." ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 30 *Alberg Odyssey 30 *Annie 30 *Aloha 30 *Bahama 30 *Bristol 29.9 *C&C; 30 *Catalina 30 *CS 30 *Grampian 30 *Hunter 30 *Leigh 30 *Mirage 30 *Nonsuch 30 *Pearson 303 *Redwing 30 *Southern Cross 28 ==References== Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Sailboat type designs by C.
