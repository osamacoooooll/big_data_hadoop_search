64082386	O (Indic)	O is a vowel of Indic abugidas. In modern Indic scripts, O is derived from the early "Ashoka" Brahmi letter 13px|ng after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. As an Indic vowel, O comes in two normally distinct forms: 1) as an independent letter, and 2) as a vowel sign for modifying a base consonant. Bare consonants without a modifying vowel sign have the inherent "A" vowel. ==ƒÄryabha·π≠a numeration== Aryabhata used Devanagari letters for numbers, very similar to the Greek numerals, even after the invention of Indian numerals. The ‡•ã sign was used to modify a consonant's value , but the vowel letter ‡§ì did not have an inherent value by itself. ==Historic O== There are three different general early historic scripts - Brahmi and its variants, Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´, and Tocharian, the so-called slanting Brahmi. O as found in standard Brahmi, 13px|O was a simple geometric shape, with variations toward more flowing forms by the Gupta 13px|O. Like all Brahmic scripts, Tocharian O 18px|O has an accompanying vowel mark for modifying a base consonant. In Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´, the only independent vowel letter is for the inherent A. All other independent vowels, including O are indicated with vowel marks added to the letter A. ===Brahmi O=== The Brahmi letter O 13px|O, is probably derived from the altered Aramaic Waw 13px, and is thus related to the modern Latin F, V, U, W, Y and Greek Upsilon. Several identifiable styles of writing the Brahmi O can be found, most associated with a specific set of inscriptions from an artifact or diverse records from an historic period.Evolutionary chart, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Vol 7, 1838 As the earliest and most geometric style of Brahmi, the letters found on the Edicts of Ashoka and other records from around that time are normally the reference form for Brahmi letters, with some vowel marks not attested until later forms of Brahmi back-formed to match the geometric writing style.

BCE) Girnar (~150 BCE) Kushana (~150-250 CE) Gujarat (~250 CE) Gupta (~350 CE) 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px ===Tocharian O=== The Tocharian letter 25px|O is derived from the Brahmi 13px|O. Unlike some of the consonants, Tocharian vowels do not have a Fremdzeichen form.

As an independent vowel, O is indicated by adding the vowel marks to the independent vowel letter A 15px|A. ==Devanagari O== ≈å (‡§í) is a vowel of the Devanagari abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|≈å, after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px|≈å. Letters that derive from it are the Gujarati letter ‡™ì, and the Modi letter ëòå. ===Devanagari Using Languages=== The Devanagari script is used to write the Hindi language, Sanskrit and the majority of Indo-Aryan languages. In most of these languages, ‡§í is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Devanagari vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound, and a vowel sign attached to base consonant to override the inherent /…ô/ vowel. ==Bengali O== ≈å (‡¶ì) is a vowel of the Bengali abugida. It is derived from the Siddha·πÉ letter 13px|≈å, and is marked by the lack of horizontal head line and less geometric shape than its Devanagari counterpart, ‡§í. ===Bengali Script Using Languages=== The Bengali script is used to write several languages of eastern India, notably the Bengali language and Assamese. In most languages, ‡¶ì is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Bengali vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound, and a vowel sign attached to base consonant to override the inherent /…î/ vowel. ==Gujarati ≈å== ≈å (‡™ì) is a vowel of the Gujarati abugida. It is derived from the Devanagari ≈å 13px|o, and ultimately the Brahmi letter 13px|o. === Gujarati-using Languages === The Gujarati script is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. In both languages, ‡™ì is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Gujarati vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound, and a vowel sign attached to base consonant to override the inherent /…ô/ vowel. ===Gujarati Candra O=== Candra O (‡™ë, short O) is a vowel of the Gujarati abugida. It is derived from the Devanagari Candra O, and ultimately the Brahmi letter 13px|o. ====Gujarati-using Languages==== The Gujarati script is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. In both languages, ‡™ë is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Gujarati vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound, and a vowel sign attached to base consonant to override the inherent /…ô/ vowel. ==Javanese O== ==Telugu O== O (‡∞í) is a vowel of the Telugu abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|O. It is closely related to the Kannada letter ‡≤í. Like in other Indic scripts, Telugu vowels have two forms: and independent letter for word and syllable-initial vowel sounds, and a vowel sign for changing the inherent "a" of Telugu consonant letters. Vowel signs in Telugu can interact with a base consonant in one of three ways: 1) the vowel sign touches or sits adjacent to the base consonant without modifying the shape of either 2) the vowel sign sits directly above the consonant, replacing its v-shaped headline, 3) the vowel sign and consonant interact, forming a ligature. Unlike other vowels, the O vowel sign has an alternate form in some typefaces that is used for the Gho, Jho, Mo and Yo syllables. thumb|200px|Telugu Gho and Gh≈ç, showing the alternate forms of the vowel marks. thumb|center|550px|Telugu O vowel sign on ‡∞ï, ‡∞ñ, ‡∞ó, ‡∞ò & ‡∞ô: Ko, Kho, Go, Gho and Ngo. Note that how the vowel sign interacts with the base consonant is dependent on the location of the headline, the absence of a headline, and the presence of a tail to attach to. ===Telugu ≈å=== In addition, Telugu also contains a second O vowel, ≈å (‡∞ì). It is also descended from the Brahmi letter 13px|O. It is closely related to the Kannada letter ‡≤ì. The long ≈å vowel sign generally interacts with a base consonant the same as short O, with an alternate vowel sign form in some typefaces for Gh≈ç, Jh≈ç, M≈ç and Y≈ç. thumb|center|550px|Telugu ≈å vowel sign on ‡∞ï, ‡∞ñ, ‡∞ó, ‡∞ò & ‡∞ô: K≈ç, Kh≈ç, G≈ç, Gh≈ç and Ng≈ç. Note that how the vowel sign interacts with the base consonant is dependent on the location of the headline, the absence of a headline, and the presence of a tail to attach to. ==Malayalam O== O (‡¥í) is a vowel of the Malayalam abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|O, via the Grantha letter x15px|O o. Like in other Indic scripts, Malayalam vowels have two forms: an independent letter for word and syllable-initial vowel sounds, and a vowel sign for changing the inherent "a" of consonant letters. Vowel signs in Malayalam usually sit adjacent to its base consonant - below, to the left, right, or both left and right, but are always pronounced after the consonant sound. ===Malayalam ≈å=== ≈å (‡¥ì, Long O) is a vowel of the Malayalam abugida. It is a variation of the regular Malayalam short O vowel that appeared after Grantha. Like other Malayalam vowels, ≈å has two forms: an independent letter for word and syllable-initial vowel sounds, and a vowel sign for changing the inherent "a" of consonant letters. ==Odia O== thumb|Odia independent and vowel sign O O (‡¨ì) is a vowel of the Odia abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|O, via the Siddha·πÉ letter x15px|O o. Like in other Indic scripts, Odia vowels have two forms: an independent letter for word and syllable-initial vowel sounds, and a vowel sign for changing the inherent "a" of consonant letters. Vowel signs in Odia usually sit adjacent to its base consonant - below, to the left, right, or both left and right, but are always pronounced after the consonant sound. No base consonants are altered in form when adding a vowel sign, and there are no consonant+vowel ligatures in Odia. ==Kaithi O== O (ëÇã) is a vowel of the Kaithi abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|O, via the Siddha·πÉ letter x15px|O O. Like in other Indic scripts, Kaithi vowels have two forms: an independent letter for word and syllable-initial vowel sounds, and a vowel sign for changing the inherent "a" of consonant letters. Vowel signs in Kaithi usually sit adjacent to its base consonant - below, to the left, right, or both left and right, but are always pronounced after the consonant sound. No base consonants are altered in form when adding a vowel sign, and there are no consonant+vowel ligatures in Kaithi. ==Comparison of O== The various Indic scripts are generally related to each other through adaptation and borrowing, and as such the glyphs for cognate letters, including O, are related as well. ==Character encodings of O== Most Indic scripts are encoded in the Unicode Standard, and as such the letter O in those scripts can be represented in plain text with unique codepoint. O from several modern-use scripts can also be found in legacy encodings, such as ISCII. ==References== Category:Indic letters
