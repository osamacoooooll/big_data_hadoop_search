The track was given the race as a result of losing their Xfinity Series race to Portland International Raceway. Both the Mid-Ohio and Portland road courses are owned and operated by Green Savoree Racing Promotions. It was the first time that Green Savoree had a total of two NASCAR national series races in any series. This race became an additional 23rd race on the Truck Series schedule. The series had 23 races in 2020 but only 22 races in 2021 as a result of the race at Iowa Speedway not being replaced with another race. The race will be 151 miles and 67 laps long according to NASCAR.com. Each of the stages will be 25 laps in length. On May 5, 2022, O'Reilly Auto Parts was announced as the title sponsor of the race. Also, "at Mid-Ohio" is part of the official name of the race (similar to races at Watkins Glen International where "at The Glen" is part of the names of the track's races), making the name of the race the "O'Reilly Auto Parts 150 at Mid-Ohio". ==Past winners== Year Date Driver Team Manufacturer Race distance Race distance Race time Average speed (mph) Report Ref Year Date Driver Team Manufacturer Laps Miles (km) Race time Average speed (mph) Report Ref 2022 July 9 75 Parker Kligerman Henderson Motorsports Chevrolet 67 151 (243) 2:19:24 65.116 Report 2023 July 8 Report ==References== ==External links== * Category:NASCAR Truck Series races Category:Annual sporting events in the United States Category:NASCAR races at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course
