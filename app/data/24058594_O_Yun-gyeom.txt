(2007). Korea in the middle: Korean studies and area studies, p. 361. The diplomatic mission functioned to the advantage of both the Japanese and the Koreans as a channel for developing a political foundation for trade.Walker, Brett L. "Foreign Affairs and Frontiers in Early Modern Japan: A Historiographical Essay", Early Modern Japan. Fall, 2002, pp. 48. This delegation was explicitly identified by the Joseon court as a "Reply and Prisoner Repatriation Envoy" (회답겸쇄환사, 回答兼刷還使). The mission was not understood to signify that relations were "normalized."Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). Frontier contact between Chosŏn Korea and Tokugawa Japan, pp. 21-24. The Joseon monarch's ambassador and retinue traveled only as far as Kyoto, where the delegation was received by Shōgun Hidetada at Fushimi Castle.Toby, p. 105 n16. ==See also== * Yeonguijeong * Joseon diplomacy * Joseon missions to Japan * Joseon tongsinsa ==Notes== ==References== * Daehwan, Noh.
