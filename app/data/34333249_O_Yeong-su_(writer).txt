He graduated from elementary school in Eonyang in 1928 and four years later traveled to Japan to attend an intensive program at Niniwa Middle School from which he graduated in 1935. He then attended Nihon University to study engineering, but acquired beri-beri and was forced to withdraw and go back to Korea. O Yeong-su returned to Japan in 1937, but quickly left again to avoid ‘voluntary’ impressment into the Japanese Imperial Army. He returned and finally graduated from the Tokyo National Arts Academy.Who's Who In Korean Literature, Hollym, 1996 p. 376 Upon his return to Korea, he quickly traveled to Manchuria, a common pathway for Koreans seeking to escape Japanese colonial rule. Sometime thereafter he returned to Korea and married in 1942. His parents died the following years: mother in 1943 and father in 1944. In 1945 he moved to Kijang Township (Tongnae County) where he taught at the Kyongnam Girls High School in nearby Busan. In 1952 he changed jobs, moving to the Pusan Middle School.Good People, Heinemann Publishing, 1986 p.xiv In 1954 O Yeong-su moved to Seoul to help prepare the first edition of the Modern Literature Journal.Good People, Heinemann Publishing, 1986 p.xvi He quickly became the editor of the journal, where he worked until an ulcer forced him to stop in 1966.

In 1949 he published his first fictional work, Nami and the Taffyman, which appeared in the New World Magazine. This was quickly followed with Wild Grapes which won an award from the Seoul News (Seoul Shinmun).Good People, Heinemann Publishing, 1986 p.xiii In 1952 O Yeong-su published Uncle in Soldiers’ Literary Digest (Sabyong Mungo) and The Woman from Hwasan in Literary Arts (Munye).

In fact, O Yeong-su is rarely overtly political and seldom judges larger political and economic systems, still, his works are laced with snapshots of what these systems result in for common citizens. ==Works in Translation== * Good People: Korean Stories (Writing in Asia Series) * Loess Valley and Other Korean Short Stories (Modern Korean Short Story Series No 1) ==Works in Korean (Partial)== * Blood-Clot (Eunghyeol, 1956) * Migratory Birds (Hujo, 1958) * The Light and the Dark (Myeongam, 1958) * A Warbler (Gaegaebi, 1959) ==Awards== * Prize of the Korean Literature Association (1955) * Asia Freedom Literature Prize (1959) == References == ==External links== * O Yeong-su Library - Eonyang, Ulsan, South Korea * Review of Good People with links to individual stories online. * Korea Journal, Vol.5 No.1 Jan 1965 Seaside Village, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.5 No.12 Dec 1965 Wild Grapes, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.6 No.6 Jun 1966 Uncle Soldier, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.7 No.8 Aug 1967 The Girl from an Island, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.8 No.5 May 1968 Adolescence, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.10 No.12 Dec 1970 Nami and the Taffyman, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.12 No.8 Aug 1972 The Migratory Bird, O Yŏng-Su * Korea Journal, Vol.16 No.9 Sep 1976 The Echo, O Yŏng-Su * KOFA Korean Film Archive, The Seashore Village (Gaenma-eul) (1965) Category:1909 births Category:1979 deaths Category:South Korean novelists Category:20th- century novelists Category:Haeju Oh clan
