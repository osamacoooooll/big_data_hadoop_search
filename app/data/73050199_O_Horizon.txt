In January 2023, Artnet reported that the film's storyline sparked objections with some of its crew, who felt uncomfortable with how closely it resembled Sackler's relationship with her own father, Jonathan Sackler, who died of cancer in 2020, and how it portrayed him in a good light. She was previously also criticized for not denouncing her family's company Purdue Pharma, infamous for its role in the opioid epidemic. One crew member allegedly quit work on the production. Sackler denied the allegations. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Upcoming films Category:American robot films Category:American science fiction comedy-drama films Category:Android (robot) films Category:Films about artificial intelligence Category:Films about fatherâ€“daughter relationships Category:Films about monkeys Category:Films directed by Madeleine Sackler Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Upcoming English-language films
