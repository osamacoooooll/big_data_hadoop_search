The park operated under the name of Adventureland Sydney and was open throughout the year. Rides included the Warthog ghost train, giant slide, water slide, miniature train, dodgem cars and many more. The park was used as a set for the television show Double the Fist. The rides at the park have also featured in movies such as Babe and Ghost Rider. The park was also used extensively in the 1983 Australian drama Hostage, and was where the first section of the movie was based.
