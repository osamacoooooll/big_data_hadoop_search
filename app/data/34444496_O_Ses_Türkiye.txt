34444496	O Ses Türkiye	O Ses Türkiye is a Turkish reality singing competition and local version of The Voice. It started on October 10, 2011. O Ses Türkiye is presented by Acun Ilıcalı (since 2011). One of the important premises of the show is the quality of singing. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the contestants in their groups and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the contestants. ==Selection process and format== O Ses Türkiye consists of four judges and a presenter. The competition includes five rounds in total. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "O ses sensin" (You're that voice). After the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects his or her coach if more than one coach expresses interest. The second round is called "Duel". Each coach pairs two of his or her team members to perform together, and then chooses one to advance in the competition. If the contestants are chosen for the 3rd round of the competition, they will be eligible to move to the next round and their performances will be broadcast live. In this round, each team's remaining contestants will compete against three or four competitors every week. After the live performances of the competitors, the results will be determined through the SMS votes. In each team, the person with the most votes is eligible to contest in the following week. The fate of the last two remaining contestants will be determined by the judges. The judges' votes give one of the competitors the right to contest at the next level. This round continues until the remaining two people from each team are determined. In the semi- final round, a total of two contestants from each team will compete in eight phases. After contestants sang their songs, the judges score their performances. The results of SMS voting will be added to the judges' score and the ones who reach 100 points will be eligible to compete in the final round. In the final round, the remaining four contestants compete against each other. After the elimination of the fourth one, the remaining contestants will sing their songs again, and the third place will be decided according to the results of a new SMS voting. The final phase is between the two competitors whose performances will be rated through the votes, and as a result, the competitor with the most votes in the contest will become the champion of O Ses Türkiye, and his/her judge's team will be chosen as the champion team. ==Series overview== : Team Mustafa : Team Hadise : Team Murat : Team Hülya : Team Gökhan : Team Ebru : Team Gökhan & Hakan : Team Sibel : Team Yıldız : Team Beyazıt : Team Seda : Team Oğuzhan O Ses Türkiye series overview Season First aired Last aired Winner Runner-up Third place Fourth place Fifth place Sixth place Winning coach Presenters Coaches (chairs' order) Network 1 2 3 4 1 10 Oct 2011 19 Feb 2012 Fidan İbrahim Şevki Fatma İşcan Bihter Erkmen rowspan="5" colspan="2" width="08%" Murat Boz Acun Ilıcalı, Alp Kırşan Hadise Mustafa Hülya Murat Show TV 2 1 Oct 2012 18 Feb 2013 Mustafa Bozkurt Ayda Mosharraf Onur Uğuş Berkan Taşkın Mustafa Sandal Star TV 3 16 Sep 2013 20 Jan 2014 Hasan Doğru Abdullah Civliz Ersin Yılmaz Mert Demir Gökhan Özoğuz Gökhan Hadise Murat Ebru 4 2014 18 Feb 2015 Elnur Hüseynov Kaya Aslantepe Emrah Güllü Zeo Jaweed Ebru Gündeş Acun Ilıcalı, Saadet Özsırkıntı Mazhar TV8 5 4 Oct 2015 2 Feb 2016 Emre Sertkaya Aziz Kiraz Türkan Kürşad Tankurt Manas Gökhan & Hakan Gökhan Murat 6 2 Oct 2016 2017 Dodan Özer Resul Aydemir Keremhan Özdemir Burhan Çatılı Taylan Bayri Cihangir Moralı Hadise Sibel 7 7 Oct 2017 6 Feb 2018 Lütfiye Özipek Ümit Durak Nihat Mugil Aydan Kahraman Oğulcan Bolcan Ceren Düzova Gökhan Özoğuz Gökhan Yıldız 8 6 Oct 2018 27 Jan 2019 Ferat Üngür Umut Kaç Barış & Baran Gülce Kahtalı Anıl Şimşek Bartu Gülhan Murat Boz Murat Beyazıt Seda 9 5 Oct 2019 15 Feb 2020 Alkan Dalgakıran Uygar Erdoğan Soner Kip Eyüp Aylar Turgut Çıngı Biran Ceren Seda Sayan 10 2 Oct 2021 21 Jan 2022 Hasan Koçak Devrim Seyrek Hakki İlek Mustafa Açikgöz Mert Yenihayat Şevval Ekiz Oğuzhan Koç Oğuzhan Beyazıt Ebru Murat ==Coaches== Coach Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Hadise Murat Boz Hülya Avşar colspan="8" Mustafa Sandal colspan="8" Gökhan Özoğuz colspan="2" colspan="3" Hakan Özoğuz colspan="4" colspan="4" Ebru Gündeş colspan="2" colspan="4" Mazhar Alanson & Özkan Uğur colspan="3" colspan="6" Sibel Can colspan="5" colspan="4" Yıldız Tilbe colspan="6" colspan="3" Beyazıt Öztürk colspan="7" Seda Sayan colspan="7" colspan="1" Oğuzhan Koç colspan="9" File:Hadise (1).jpg|Hadise (2011–2020) File:Murat Boz Ekim 2011 (1) - Cropped.jpg|Murat Boz (2011–2013; 2015–) File:Hülya Avşar.jpg|Hülya Avşar (2011–2012) File:Noimage.svg|Mustafa Sandal (2011–2012) File:Gökhan Özoğuz.JPG|Gökhan Özoğuz (solo: 2013–2014, 2017; duo: 2015–2016) File:Ebru Gündeş 2011 Antalya.jpg|Ebru Gündeş (2013–2015, 2021–) File:Mazhar Alanson 2009.jpg|Mazhar Alanson (duo, 2014) File:Özkan Uğur.png|Özkan Uğur (duo, 2014) File:Noimage.svg|Hakan Özoğuz (duo, 2015–2016) File:Sibel 2011 Antalya.jpg|Sibel Can (2016) File:Yıldız Tilbe - Konser01 (cropped).jpg|Yıldız Tilbe (2017) File:Beyazıt Öztürk (1).jpg|Beyazıt Öztürk (2018–) File:Noimage.svg|Seda Sayan (2018–2019) File:Oğuzhan Koç.jpg|Oğuzhan Koç (2021–) ==Season synopses== * Winner coach * Runner-up * Third place * Fourth place Winners are in bold, eliminated artists in smaller font.
