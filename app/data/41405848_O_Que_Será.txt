Allmusic Review December 19, 2013 The Guardian's John Fordham noted "The Italian pianist Bollani and the Brazilian De Holanda, who plays the bandolim (a 10-string mandolin), have worked up a largely South American repertoire of tangos and love songs, variously treating them with dazzling virtuosity, humour and captivating tenderness... This remarkable duo's pleasure in their work is infectious".Fordham, J. The Guardian Review, August 30, 2013 All About Jazz correspondent Ian Patterson wrote "The chemistry between Bollani and de Holanda and the almost inexhaustible material at their disposal clamor for a follow-up... O Que Será marks a high point in the discographies of both musicians".Patterson, I. All About Jazz review, September 5, 2013 On the same site John Kelman commented "The inclusion of audience reactions throughout the show help make O Que Sera a breathtaking 54-minute break from life's trials and tribulations; as close to being there as any audio recording can be, it's proof positive that serious music can be fun, too".Kelman, J.
