Berkeley's Department of East Asian Languages.오세영 - Digital Library of Korean Literature (LTI Korea) O Seyeong's volume Night-Sky Checkerboard was translated into English in 2016, published in the United States and listed by the Chicago Review of Books as one of the twelve best poetry collections of 2016.Chicago Review of BooksMunhwa Ilbo ==Writing== O Seyeong's early works contained significant amounts of "deconstructive" poetry, leading him to be classified as a modernist poet. However, he did not simply stay fixed on linguistic experiments. He gradually became fascinated with Eastern philosophies, and based on that, he worked on lyrical depiction of humanity's existential agony. Through poetry, he shows eternity and infinity, which should be naturally sought after when one is in a state of namelessness. He attempts to show the proper way of life that people with enlightened sense of existence must strive for. ‘Namelessness’ is a Buddhist word that describes a state when the mind has not yet reached intrinsic enlightenment, but rather captured by desires and ego. Today O Seyeong is described as a poet who has lyrical sense, philosophical intellect, and sophisticated linguistic awareness.Kim Seongi, Walk Through Contemporary Poetry in Namdo (), Chonnam National University Press, 2007: 136. He writes as he bores into the double-sidedness and hypocrisy of existence. One of his major works, Bird (), depicts birds that soar into the sky toward the truth and freedom, but ultimately must fall, showing humanity's fateful burden. Like how if a poem flies higher, the distance back to the ground get further, this work contains the insight that though humans strive endlessly for the ideal, they are ultimately fatalistic beings that must return to the ground. The Chicago Review of Books said that O Seyeong's “attention to detail, and his ability to shift back and forth between scopes both grand and minuscule, provide a sense that his poems are inextricably linked to something larger,” noting that his poetry collections “work very much obsessed with existence, the building and destruction of nature, business, war, and industry. He unexpectedly examines merit, plays with worth, while lingering on the edge of past and present.”Chicago Review of Books ==Works== ===Poetry collections=== * Rebelling Light (, 1970) * The Evening of the Darkest Day (, 1982) * The Soil of Contradiction (, 1985) * Nameless Beginning of the Year (, 1986) * The Burning Water (, 1988) * The Other Side of Love (, 1990) * Flowers Long for Stars (, 1990) * Darkness Exists Even in God's Heaven (, 1991) * Foolish Hegel!
