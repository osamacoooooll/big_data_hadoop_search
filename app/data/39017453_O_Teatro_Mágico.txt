With the intention of saving money to record an album, he quit the band and went to the U.S, where he worked as a waiter. It was there where he first came into contact with Hermann Hesse's novel Steppenwolf, in which the protagonist runs into a man advertising "The Magical Theater". Anitelli took inspiration from this and named the album he was working on "The Magical Theater" as a homage to the book.MTV UK (2012) http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/o-teatro-magico Anitelli is the main composer and one of the actors, along with other 10 performers: 7 musicians and 3 circus artists. Together, they started a movement called “Musicas Para Baixar – MPB” ("Music for Download", a pun with the brazilian genre of music, MPB) supporting the free sharing of music via the Internet. All of their songs are available online. == Musical style and influences == Fernando Anitelli said in an interview that their influence goes from the bands and singers Secos e Molhados, Dave Matthews Band, Antônio Nóbrega, Chico César, Tom Zé, Silvério Pessoa, Raul Seixas and Legião Urbana, to the writers Hermann Hesse, Mário Quintana, Clarice Lispector, Denise Stoklos and Plínio Marcos.O Teatro Mágico Website http://www.oteatromagico.mus.br/ The group is not only diverse in its genres, but also in its musical instruments.
