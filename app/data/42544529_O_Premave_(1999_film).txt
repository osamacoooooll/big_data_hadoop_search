During the first half of the film, especially, the story moves at a snail's pace [..] The only consolation is Seetharam’s photography and Umasri, Kashi and Sunderraj’s comedic talents." == References == == External links == * Category:1999 films Category:1999 romantic drama films Category:1990s Kannada-language films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Kannada remakes of Telugu films Category:Films scored by V.
