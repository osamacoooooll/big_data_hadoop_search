24148543	O'Cayz Corral	O'Cayz Corral was a downtown Madison, Wisconsin bar and music venue that primarily featured local and national punk, rock, and grunge musical acts. == History == Located in Madison, Wisconsin, United States, O'Cayz Corral was originally named Don's Shell (Owned by Don & Cay Millard) and later renamed Millard's Bar.Millards Tavern Website Catherine "Cay" Millard became sole owner of the tavern in 1980 and changed the name to O'Cayz Corral, a country- western themed bar with a legal capacity of 150. Sometime in the early 80's Cay began to ask local musicians such as Pat MacDonald (who later formed Timbuk 3) if they would like to play at the venue, but it was not until The Replacements were booked for two back-to-back shows that the venue became well known for live music. It was operated by "Cay" until her death in 1990. Four of the children (Mike, Mary, Pat, Don) formed a corporation "Cayz Corp" and continued the business. They then leased the club to Cathy Dethmers from 1994 until 2001.A History of O'Cayz - Wisconsin State Journal Referred to in the press as "iconic" and the "CBGB's of the Midwest,"Planet Propaganda Website O'Cayz featured many underground punk, grunge, and rock bands that later became major contributors to pop culture. Indeed, at one time many touring bands had O'Cayz Corral on their bucket list of places to play. Some famous bands such as Nirvana, Soul Asylum and Living Colour only played there once. Other famous bands such as The Smashing Pumpkins only played there a couple of times or so, while bands like L7 graced the venue twice a year for several years—even after they were selling out stadiums elsewhere. People best remember two events at O'Cayz, aside from the many fine performances there. A drunk truck driver smashed into and destroyed the front facade of the building, also killing a 22-year-old University of Wisconsin student and destroying the band Surgery's ambulance filled with their equipment. On another occasion, the floor caved in on the dance floor during a Royal Crescent Mob performance.Splendid E-Zine O'Cayz was destroyed by a fire that began in the 'Cay's Comic-Strip', a neighborhood bar at 502 East Wilson St., also owned by the family of Cay Millard, on January 1, 2001. Dethmers reopened nearby in 2004 as the High Noon Saloon. == Location == O'Cayz Corral was located on the isthmus of Madison's near east side, a short walk from the state capitol, marking a transitional space between the capitol and the fashionable Jenifer-Spaight historic district. Despite the many up-and-coming, on the cusp of breaking-through musicians who played at O'Cayz before—and sometimes after—finding success, the physical plant was very small. The primary section of the L-shaped space spanned only about 20 feet in width and 70 feet in depth, and accommodated a bar and several tables. == Featured artists == Somehttps://www.setlist.fm/venue/ocayz-corral-madison-wi- usa-2bd6304e.html of the bands that played at O'Cayz Corral between 1985 and 2001 (listed alphabetically with reference to any live recordings released of the show): * 7 Seconds * 7 Year Bitch * 24-7 Spyz * 60 Cycle Hum * 311 * The Afghan Wigs * Agent Orange * Alex Chilton * Adrenalin O.D. * American Music Club * Animated Violence * Appliances-SFB * Archers of Loaf * Arson Garden * Art Paul Schlosser * Asphalt Ballet * At The Drive- Inhttps://www.setlist.fm/venue/ocayz-corral-madison-wi-usa-2bd6304e.html * The Atomic Bitchwax * Aunt Beaph Video on YouTube of 11/13/98 show * Babes in Toyland * Bad Brains * Bash & Pop * Bazooka * The BellRays * Better Off Airport * Beyond Possession * Big BlackLive at O'Cayz Corral Website * Big Hat * Blanche Mobile * The Blue Meanies * Bongzillahttps://www.setlist.fm/venue/ocayz-corral-madison-wi- usa-2bd6304e.html Gestation, recorded February 7, 1998, was included on the Twin Threat To Your Sanity compilation released on 7", 7", and All Media by Bad People Records, Riotous Assembly, and Selfish Fucker Records in 2001.
