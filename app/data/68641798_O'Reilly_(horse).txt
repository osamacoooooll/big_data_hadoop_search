68641798	O'Reilly (horse)	O'Reilly (24 August 1993 - 31 December 2014) was a New Zealand bred and trained thoroughbred racehorse who won two Group 1 races. O'Reilly was bred by Waikato Stud Holdings Limited. His dam, Courtza, was the winner of the 1989 Golden Slipper Stakes. He was named after the Irish international rugby player and businessman Tony O'Reilly. He was entered in the 1995 Karaka Yearling Sales but was unable to be sold when he failed a veterinary test, due to an abnormality in his larynx, so he was retained by his owner, Gary Chittick. ==Racing career== O'Reilly was initially placed with Melbourne trainer, Gerald Ryan, but due to injuries was put out to paddock for eight months. After his rest he was then trained by Dave and Paul O'Sullivan at Matamata and ridden in all his races by Lance O'Sullivan. In the November 1996 Bayer Classic Group 1 event for 3 year old horses at Otaki, he beat High Return and Rebel. In January 1997, he contested the Telegraph Handicap at Trentham, an open handicap event over 1200m, winning by 2 3/4 lengths in 1:07.36 over Krispin Klear and Jazzac. On 15 February 1997, he placed second to Mouawad in the Australian Guineas 1600m at Flemington Racecourse. However, during his next start, in the 1200m Newmarket Handicap at Flemington, he ruptured a suspensory ligament which finished his racing career after only six race day starts. Remarkably, Oâ€™Reilly was New Zealand Horse of the Year for 1996 and 1997, champion sprinter, and champion miler.New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Annual 1997 (26th edition). Dillon, Mike, Editor.
