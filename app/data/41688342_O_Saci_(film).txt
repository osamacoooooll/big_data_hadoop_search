Released only four years after the death of author Monteiro Lobato, on 10 September 1953, O Saci was a commercial success and helped to make Lobato's work popular for both children and adults, and especially among illiterate people. The film is still well remembered and had a second premiere at its 60th anniversary, at the Amazonas Film Festival. ==References== ==External links== * * https://web.archive.org/web/20101106014318/http://www.oretorno.com.br/galerias_nanni_folder/o_saci/index.htm - Gallery with cast reunion and stills of the movie.
