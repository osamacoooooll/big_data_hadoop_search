55481603	O Outro Lado do Paraíso	O Outro Lado do Paraíso (title in English: The Other Side of Paradise) is a Brazilian telenovela created by Walcyr Carrasco, which premiered on TV Globo on 23 October 2017, replacing A Força do Querer, and ended on 11 May 2018, being replaced by Segundo Sol. The telenovela features an ensemble cast headed by Bianca Bin, Sérgio Guizé, Rafael Cardoso, Grazi Massafera, Érika Januza, Emílio de Mello, Thiago Fragoso, Glória Pires, Marieta Severo and Fernanda Montenegro. == Plot == The plot has two phases and begins in Tocantins. The first phase, set in 2007, presents the teacher Clara (Bianca Bin), an innocent young orphan who lives with her grandfather, a bar owner Josafá (Lima Duarte) in Jalapão. She meets Gael (Sergio Guizé), an heir to a decaying family of Palmas, and ends up falling in love with him. However, Clara suffers from his explosive and extremely sexist temper and but ends up being advised by Sophia (Marieta Severo), her mother-in-law, to be understanding. Behind Sophia's demureness, which is just a facade, hides an ambition for the lands of Josafá, where a depleted emerald mine has been discovered, in which neither he nor his granddaughter have the least interest in exploiting after a tragedy that causes Clara's father and son of Josafá, Jonas (Eucir de Souza) to perish. Sophia, a domineering, self-willed, cunning and false woman, plans a plan to get rid of Clara, eventually putting her daughter-in-law in a psychiatric clinic for 10 years. The second phase, set in the present time, presents Clara trying to escape from the psychiatric clinic, without understanding how she got there, but discovers she was the victim of a major coup. She meets with the mysterious Beatriz (Nathalia Timberg), her only friend. He meets Renato (Rafael Cardoso), a friend in love with her, who will help her in her revenge plan against seven people: Sophia, Gael, the sensual and dangerous sister-in- law Livia (Grazi Massafera), Judge Gustavo (Luís Melo) and his wife Nádia (Eliane Giardini), psychiatrist Samuel (Eriberto Leão) and delegate Vinicius (Flávio Tolezani), while trying to find again her son Tomaz (Vitor Figueiredo), father and grandmother, some of Clara's foes. == Production == Cauã Reymond and Carolina Dieckmann were featured main roles in the plot, but the first declined because of movie commitments, while Dieckmann preferred to accept an invitation to the next telenova by Aguinaldo Silva. Both were replaced by Rafael Cardoso and Grazi Massafera. Nathalia Dill was invited shortly afterwards for the role, but also refused, claiming that she needed time to rest her image since she had just starred in 'Rock Story'. Maitê Proença was one of those who left the cast later. The actress Laís Pinho was announced for the cast of the plot, but in August it was announced that she would act in the next telenovela by Record, O Apocalipse. The release of a part of the plot synopsis caused some estrangement from the resemblance to the American soap opera La Patrona. Both have in common the fact that the girl is hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic by the villain of the plot. == Cast == * Bianca Bin as Clara Tavares * Sérgio Guizé as Gael Montserrat * Marieta Severo as Sophia Montserrat * Glória Pires as Elizabeth Montserrat * Rafael Cardoso as Renato Laureiro * Grazi Massafera as Lívia Montserrat * Lima Duarte as Josafá Tavares * Fernanda Montenegro as Mercedes Alcântara * Thiago Fragoso as Patrick de Sá Junqueira * Eliane Giardini as Nádia Vasconcelos * Caio Paduan as Bruno Vasconcelos * Érika Januza as Raquel Custódio * Nathalia Timberg as Beatriz de Sá Junqueira * Juliano Cazarré as Mariano * Flávio Tolezani as Vinicius Gomes * Eriberto Leão as Samuel dos Passos * Luís Melo as Gustavo Vasconcelos * Julia Dalavia as Adriana Montserrat * Emílio de Mello as Henrique Montserrat * Juca de Oliveira as Natanael Montserrat * Bárbara Paz as Joana Medeiros * Laura Cardoso as Madame Caetana * Zezé Motta as Mãe Quilombo * Anderson di Rizzi as Juvenal * Pedro Carvalho as Amaro Antunes * Arthur Aguiar as Diego Vasconcelos * Genésio de Barros as Raúl Ignácio Barros * Juliana Caldas as Julia de Aguiar Monserrat * Ana Lúcia Torre as Adneia dos Passos * Tainá Müller as Aura * Ellen Rocche as Suzana * Fábio Lago as Nick * Mayana Neiva as Leandra * Bella Piero as Laura Sandoval * Rafael Zulu as Aparecido * Fernanda Rodrigues as Fabiana de Sá Junqueira * Igor Angelkorte as Rafael * Giovana Cordeiro as Cleo Alcântara * Sandra Corveloni as Lorena Sandoval * Vera Mancini as Rosalinda * Sérgio Fonta as Amaral * Malu Rodrigues as Karina * César Ferrario as Rato * Felipe Titto as Odilo * Narjara Turetta as Zildete * Alexandre Rodrigues as Valdo * Rafael Losso as Zé Victor == Soundtrack == === Volume 1 === O Outro Lado do Paraíso Vol. 1 is the first soundtrack of the telenovela, released on 10 November 2017 by Som Livre. === Volume 2 === O Outro Lado do Paraíso Vol. 2 is the second soundtrack of the telenovela, released on 20 February 2018 by Som Livre. == Ratings == Timeslot (BRT/AMT) Episodes First aired Last aired viewers (points) Date Viewers (points) Date Viewers (points) MondaySaturday 9:20pm 172 35 48 38 == Awards and nominations == Year Awards Category Recipient Result Ref. 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 Troféu Internet 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 Year Awards Category Recipient Result Ref. 2018 Troféu Imprensa 2019 Troféu Imprensa Year Awards Category Recipient Result Ref. 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 Prêmio Jovem Brasileiro 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 Year Awards Category Recipient Result Ref. 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 Prêmio Nelson Rodrigues 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 Year Awards Category Recipient Result Ref. 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 Melhores do Ano 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 == References == ==External links== * * Category:TV Globo telenovelas Category:2017 telenovelas Category:2017 Brazilian television series debuts Category:Telenovelas by Walcyr Carrasco Category:Brazilian LGBT- related television shows Category:2018 Brazilian television series endings Category:Television shows filmed in Tocantins Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas Category:Television series about revenge
