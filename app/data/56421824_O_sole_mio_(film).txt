56421824	O sole mio (film)	O sole mio is a 1946 Italian film, directed by Giacomo Gentilomo. It is considered one of the earliest films belonging to the genre of Italian neorealism, due to its use of exterior scenes and the inclusion of non- professional actors. The film is set during the Four days of Naples in September 1943. Its title refers to the Neapolitan song "â€™O sole mio". Tito Gobbi stars as an Italian-American officer who is parachuted behind Axis lines to gather information on the movements of the German army and facilitate the allied landing. In Naples he comes into contact with local resistance groups and ordinary citizens, who then join in the revolt against the German occupiers. ==See also== *Cinema of Italy ==External links== * Category:1946 films Category:1946 war films Category:Italian war films Category:1940s Italian-language films Category:Films about Italian resistance movement Category:Films set in Naples Category:Italian Campaign of World War II films Category:Films directed by Giacomo Gentilomo Category:Italian black-and-white films Category:Italian World War II films Category:1940s Italian films
