To give the boat better performance O'Day added a new, patented winged keel which is said to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride in a seaway. And the 302 also comes equipped with a filly battened mainsail which is less sensitive to trim, and holds its shape better in light air." ==See also== *List of sailing boat types ==References== ==External links== * Category:Keelboats Category:Dinghies Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Sailboat type designs by C.
