At the request of the Commission de toponymie du Canada, the name "Rivière O'Sullivan" has been attributed to evoke the work of life of Henry O'Sullivan (Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault], 1845 - Loretteville, 1912). After studying at Laval University in 1869, O'Sullivan worked as a land surveyor, geologist and explorer in the Department of Lands and Forests.
