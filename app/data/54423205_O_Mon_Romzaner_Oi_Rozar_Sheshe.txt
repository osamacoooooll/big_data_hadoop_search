54423205	O Mon Romzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe	O Môn Rômzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe Elo Khushir Eid () is the most notable Bengali Eid-ul-Fitr song, written by Kazi Nazrul Islam, the national poet of Bangladesh. It is a very common tune heard in Bengali Muslim households around the world. The song was written and composed at the request of Nazrul's disciple, Abbasuddin Ahmed in 1931. It has been covered by many artists around the world. The song is written on the end of the period of fasting and the Islamic holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr. This was regarded by his contemporaries as a significant achievement, as Bengali Muslims had been strongly averse to devotional music.Kamrunnessa Azad. 2001. Dharmiya Chetonay Nazrul.
