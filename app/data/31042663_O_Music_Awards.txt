31042663	O Music Awards	The O Music Awards (commonly abbreviated as the OMAs) is an awards show presented by MTV to honour music, technology and intersection between the two. The 1st O Music Award ceremony was held on April 28, 2011 on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas. The 3rd O Music Awards was held on June 27, 2012. The O Music Awards brand continues year-round through a combination of a music and tech blog, called 'The O Music Blog', and a New York-based live events' series called 'Unboxed, which features music, tech, art, and interactivity. Past winners include Spotify (Best Music Hosting App), Björk (Digital Genius Award), Way Out West (Most Innovative Festival), Crowd Juke (Best Music Hack) and Lady Gaga (A Must-Follow Artist On Twitter and an Innovative Artist). The show has also featured up-and-coming acts like Foster The People and Alabama Shakes, as well as having many icons like The Flaming Lips and Robyn. Running in tandem with the awards and performances, O Music Awards has achieved 3 Guinness World Records. During the inaugural O Music Awards in Las Vegas in April 2011, rapper Chiddy of Chiddy Bang received Guinness World Records titles for the Longest Freestyle Rap and the Longest Marathon Rapping record after rapping for 9 hours, 16 minutes and 22 seconds. For O Music Awards 2, the show took on the goal of the Longest Team Dance Marathon. A group of 13 dancers assembled at LA’s famed club The Roxy on Halloween Eve to take on the record. 24 hours later, all 13 dancers were still standing and had broken the record. The effort also raised more than $32,000 to fight bullying, with the money being divided equally between the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN), the It Gets Better Project, the Gay Straight Alliance Network (GSA), Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), and The Trevor Project. == Award Winners == ===2011=== O Music Awards 2011: I # Best Fan Cover: Alex Goot # Funniest Music Short: Lonely Island, I Just Had Sex # Innovative Artist: Lady Gaga # Must Follow Artist on Twitter: Lady Gaga # Most Innovative Music Video: Andy Grammer, Keep Your Head Up # Fan Army FTW: Tokio Hotel’s Aliens # NSFW Music Video: Thirty Seconds to Mars, "Hurricane" # Most Viral Dance: Willow Smith, Whip My Hair # Best Independent Music Blog: Aquarium Drunkard # Best Music Discovery Service: Pandora # Best Performance Series: Daryl Hall, "Live From Daryl’s House" # Favourite F**k Yeah Tumblr: F**k Yeah Adam Lambert # Favourite Animated GIF: Nicki Minaj # Best Fan Forum: Michael Jackson – MJJ Community # Best Music Hack: Invisible Instruments # Best Animal Performance: Parrot Dancing To Willow Smith’s Whip My Hair # Best Tweet: Kanye West – “I hate when I’m on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle” O Music Awards 2011: II # Must Follow Artist on Twitter: Adam Lambert # Fan Army FTW: Tokio Hotel's Aliens # Best Lyrics Video: Joe Jonas, See No More # Best Artist With a Camera Phone: Demi Lovato # Oops I Did It Online: James Blunt # Best Web-Born Artist: Kina Grannis # Best Vintage Viral Video: Nirvana Smells Like Teen Spirit # Digital Genius Award: Björk # Best Fan Cover: Marc Martel Somebody to Love by Queen # Hottest Music NILF: Katie Morse # WTF I Love This Award: Nyan Cat # Too Much Ass for TV: Marilyn Manson, "Born Villain" # Most Outrageous Tweet: @BritneySpears to @DJPaulyD: "Hope you enjoyed your dance!
