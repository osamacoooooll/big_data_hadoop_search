The text is adapted from the Latin Vulgate translation of Lamentations 1:12. It was often set, especially in the sixteenth century, as part of the Tenebrae Responsories for Holy Saturday. Some of the most famous settings of the text are by: * Tomás Luis de Victoria (two settings for four voices: 1572 and 1585) * Carlo Gesualdo (five voices: 1603; six voices: 1611) * Pablo Casals (mixed choir: 1932) ==Text== > O vos ómnes qui transítis per víam, atténdite et vidéte: > : Si est dólor símilis sícut dólor méus.

Translation > O all you who walk by on the road, pay attention and see: > : if there be any sorrow like my sorrow. V.
