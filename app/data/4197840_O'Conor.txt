4197840	O'Conor	The O'Conor dynasty (Middle Irish: Ó Conchobhair; Modern ) are an Irish noble dynasty and formerly one of the most influential and distinguished royal dynasties in Ireland. The O'Conor family held the throne of the Kingdom of Connacht up until 1475. Having ruled it on and off since 967, they ruled continuously from 1102 to 1475. Moreover, the O'Conor parent house the Uí Briúin and Síol Muireadaigh ruled Connacht on many occasions – but not continuously – between 482 and 956. The house of O'Conor also produced two High Kings of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair and his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the last High King of Ireland. The family seat is Clonalis House outside Castlerea in County Roscommon. The current O'Conor Don is Desmond O'Conor (b. 22 September 1938) who lives in Rotherfield, East Sussex in England.Curley, W. Vanishing Kingdoms. Dublin. Lilliput Press. ==History== The Ó Conor Don is the head of a lineage which provided about one hundred Kings of Connacht, thirty Chiefs of the Name and two High Kings of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156), and his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (c. 1115–1198), the last High King. During the late 14th century, the Ó Conor dynasty was grouped into two main divisions, one led by Toirdhealbhach Óg Donn Ó Conchobair, the other by Felim MacAedh Ó Conchobair. From these descended the families of Ó Conchubhair Donn anglicized as O'Conor Don and Ó Conchubhair Ruadh anglicized as O'Conor Roe (now extinct). The O'Conor family like all Gaelic Nobility followed Brehon law system up until the 16th century. Therefore, they did not follow primogeniture. The Kings, or Chiefs of the O'Conor family would be elected by a close kinship group. This did frequently result in bitter feuds and lead to civil wars within the Kingdom, therefore at times dramatically weakening the family's power in Connacht and in Ireland. ==Descent from Turlough Mor O'Conor, Monarch of Ireland== *Turlough Mor O'Conor, High King of Ireland and King of Connacht **Cathal Crobhdearg O'Conor, King of Connacht ***Aedh O'Conor, King of Connacht ****Cathal Dall O'Conor *****Aedh MacCathal O'Conor ****Ruaidri MacAedh O'Conor *****Eoghan mac Ruaidri Ó Conor ******Aedh O'Conor, King of Connacht *******Turlough O'Conor, King of Connacht (Ancestor of the O'Conor Don Sept) *******Felim O'Conor, King of Connacht (Ancestor of the O'Conor Roe Sept) ***Felim O'Conor, King of Connacht ****Aedh O'Conor, King of Connacht ****Aedh Muimnech O'Conor, King of Connacht == The O'Conor Don line== thumb|Isabella, Countess O'Rourke, grandmother of Charles O'Conor of Ballinagare (1710–1791). thumb|Denis O'Conor of Ballinagare (Donnchadh Liath) (b. 1674), Charles' father. thumb|Charles O'Conor of Ballinagare (1710–1791) , in middle age. thumb|Denis O'Conor of Ballinagare (1732–1804), Charles' eldest son, in middle age. thumb|Charles O'Conor of Mount Allen (1736–1808) as a young man. thumb|Revd Dr Charles O'Conor (1764–1828), grandson of Charles O'Conor of Ballinagare (1710-1791) who was also a historian of note but created controversy during his lifetime. thumb|Owen O'Conor of Ballinagare.
