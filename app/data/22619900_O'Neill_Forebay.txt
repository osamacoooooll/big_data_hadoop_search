22619900	O'Neill Forebay	O'Neill Forebay is a forebay to the San Luis Reservoir created by the construction of O'Neill Dam across San Luis Creek approximately west of Los Banos, California, United States, on the eastern slopes of the Pacific Coast Ranges of Merced County. ==Background== Roughly downstream from the San Luis Dam, O'Neill Forebay collects irregular water releases from the San Luis Dam and the 424 MW pumped-storage hydroelectric William R. Gianelli Powerplant in its basin. A morning-glory type spillway lies at the left bank of the reservoir. The reservoir is fed by the California Aqueduct and the Delta–Mendota Canal. Water from the canal is lifted a vertical distance of into a channel running into the forebay. ==O'Neill Dam== O'Neill Dam, constructed from 1963 to 1967, is an , earthfill and rockfill dam, stretching over across the valley of San Luis Creek. With a maximum reservoir depth of , peak inflow to the forebay is per second, from both the San Luis Dam and the Delta–Mendota Canal. The drainage area of the reservoir downstream of the San Luis Dam is only . The O'Neill Pumping-Generating Plant stores 28 megawatts hours of energy. == Recreation== The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed an advisory for O'Neill Forebay because of mercury and PCBs found in fish caught here. The advisory provides safe eating advice for multiple fish species. The largest striped bass caught in California was caught in the O’Neill Forebay. The fish, and weighing , was caught on August 5, 2008, by Frank Ualat of Gilroy, California. ==See also== *List of dams and reservoirs in California *List of lakes in California ==References== * == External links == * Category:Reservoirs in Merced County, California Category:Central Valley Project Category:Reservoirs in California Category:Reservoirs in Northern California
